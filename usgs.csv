Assuming that flow to wells is radially symmetric, the pressure depression will be in a conic shape and the hydraulic gradient of the cone of depression causes water to flow at a constant rate from the recharge boundary to the well. Such a hydraulic condition in the aquifer is known as a steady flow condition. The flux of steady radial flow Q in a confined aquifer (i.e., the reservoir is bounded on the top and bottom by impervious confining layers) with an intrinsic permeability K can be described by: Q = (2πrb)K dhdr ,(6)  where r is the radial distance from the center of the pumping well; b is the thickness of the confined reservoir; and dh/dr is the hydraulic gradient. Note that h here is the water head and water pressure can be calculated using the water head times the unit weight of water Pw = γwh. Integrating Eq. (6) gives: Q = 2πbK h(r) −hwln(rrw),(7)  where h(r) is the water head at a radial distance r from the center of the well; hw is the water head at the well boundary and rw is the radius of the well. Meanwhile, the flux in an unconfined reservoir (i.e., no top or bottom sealing layers) can be characterized by: Q = πKh2(r) −h2wln(rrw).(8) Based on Eqs. (7) and (8) and assuming a production flux of Q = 0.001 m3/s (~86 m3/day, or ~3000 standard cubic feet/day), a reservoir thickness of b = 60 m, and a production well with radius rw = 0.1 m (Note: these parameters all correspond to the Nankai Trough hydrate reservoir, Fujii et al.13), calculated hydraulic gradients away from the production well boundary are shown in Fig. 10b. Based on the logging estimate range of intrinsic permeability values for the reser­voir13, we calculate results for three permeabilities: K = 0.1, 1, and 10 mD. The results suggest that a higher hydraulic gradient is observed in confined reservoirs than in unconfined ones, and reservoirs with low intrinsic permeability tend to have higher hydraulic gradients near the wellbore. Note also that the hydraulic gradient will increase at a larger production flux or a thinner reservoir (refer to Eq. 7). This is the case for GC955 where the hydrate reservoir is a stacked sequence of hydrate-bearing sandy silt layers confined by clayey silt interbeds. Nevertheless, these results highlight that permeability measured in the laboratory using a low hydraulic gradient can overestimate the field flow performance at a much greater hydraulic gradient, particularly near the production wellbore. Although, in a reservoir with higher intrinsic permeability, the gradient near the wellbore will likely be lower (Fig. 10b). Numerical modeling of gas production from the Alaska site1 suggests the peak rate of gas production drops from 15 × 104 ST m3/day to 9.5 × 104 ST m3/day (i.e., 63 % reduction, where ST m3/day signifies standard cubic meters of gas per day) for reservoirs with a decrease in permeability from 10 mD to 0.1 mD. Reservoir modeling for the gas hydrate reservoir NGHP-02 Site 16 offshore eastern India sug­gests the production rate decrease due to the same permeability reduction (10–0.1 mD) is an order of magnitude or more25. Therefore, considering the negative impacts of increased hydraulic gradient near the production wellbore, which can reduce the effective permeability by one order of magnitude, the peak gas production rate can be expected to drop substantially. 5. Conclusions Remolded samples can yield (vertical) permeability values that are consistent with intact samples and are representative of the in situ condition; however, they do not capture the permeability anisotropy or the stress-dependent permeability anisotropy evolution of intact cores, Fig. 10.

Given the thinly interbedded nature of the GC996 sediments, relative permeability in the horizontal direction is expected to be very different from that measured in the vertical direction. Moreover, those thin, low- permeability interbed layers will tend to restrict vertical fluid flow during production and confine the reservoir response to primarily hor­izontal fluid flow. Research to estimate horizontal relative permeability to gas from the vertical relative permeability to gas with known permeability anisotropy in sediments can support more precise evalua­tion of the gas production performance for thinly-layered reservoirs. In addition to considering the effects of lithology and the flow di­rection on permeability, our study highlights the importance of considering the flow conditions themselves. Measured permeability decreases exponentially with increased hydraulic gradient. Thus, the increased hydraulic gradient near the production well can substantially lower the effective permeability in the sediments. The current method that quantifies permeability in the vertical direction under a low hy­draulic gradient (i.e., ASTM standards recommend i = 10–30) can pro­vide an upper bound on permeability, but lead to an overestimate of a reservoir’s flow performance. The hydraulic gradient near a production well increases as the pro­duction flux increases and for a thinner reservoir. The GC955 hydrate reservoir is a stacked sequence of thinly layered hydrate-bearing sandy silt sediments confined by clayey silt interbeds, implying high hydraulic gradients during gas production. Our results show that a hydraulic gradient of 500 can reduce the permeability by one order of magnitude, resulting in a significant reduction in the peak gas production rate. When evaluating reservoir flow performance, factors like perme­ability anisotropy, horizontal relative permeability, hydrate saturation, stress conditions, and hydraulic gradient must all be considered. Permeability anisotropy measured in this study uses cores from both a sandy silt and a clayey silt layer. However, the hydrate reservoir at GC955 of the Gulf of Mexico is highly interbedded with these two faces combining to form a series of thin and confined coarse layers with hy­drate, and thus, both the reservoir-scale permeability anisotropy and the hydraulic gradient near the production well are expected to be signifi­cant. The results also highlight the importance of using intact and interbedded samples to better understand their flow performance at the Gulf of Mexico hydrate reservoir.

Numerous laboratory permeability studies using local soils, glass beads, or microfluidics containing synthesized hydrates have also been reviewed23. However, reported permeability in natural hydrate-bearing sedi­ments using field or laboratory techniques, even on co-located sediment, can vary by several orders of magnitude16, possibly because these methods quantify the permeability in different directions (i.e., hori­zontal flow in XPT and vertical flow in pressure cores), across different length scales8, and are based on different simplifying assumptions47, in addition to other factors like sampling disturbance6,36. Also, ASTM standards require the unitless hydraulic gradient, i, given by i = Δh/L, where Δh (m) is the loss of water head along a distance L (m), to be 10–30 in laboratory permeability measurements. In the field, however, the gradient can be an order of magnitude or more higher, particularly near a production well38. Understanding various influencing factors and their impacts on measured permeability in hydrate-bearing sediments is of both scientific and practical importance given the prominence of permeability in dictating methane production rates from gas hydrate-bearing sediments. This study investigates permeability anisotropy and the impact of the hydraulic gradient on measured permeability in hydrate reservoir sed­iments recovered from the layered gas hydrate deposit at GC955 in the Gulf of Mexico12. Intact cores and remolded samples are characterized here. Their vertical and horizontal permeability with and without tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrate are measured at hydraulic gradients up to 500, which as derived in Section 4.3, corresponds to the gradient near the wellbore for an unconfined reservoir with 1 mD permeability. The results enhance the understanding of the hydraulic behavior of hydrate-bearing sediments in the field and highlight that permeability anisotropy, hydrate saturation, stress conditions, and hydraulic gradient have substantial impacts on reservoir permeability. 2. Experimental design 2.1. Specimen characterization The two specimens, 3FB1 (419.24–419.44 m below seafloor, mbsf) and 4FB6 (422.50 – 422.60 mbsf), investigated in this study were recovered from the Green Canyon 955 hydrate reservoir in the deep- water Gulf of Mexico as a part of the DOE/UT GOM2 field expedi­tion12. These specimens were from a coarser-grained hydrate-bearing layer and a finer-grained reservoir interbed layer respectively. As sum­marized by Flemings et al.12 and Thomas et al.36, the cores were both collected from Hole H005 (27◦0.04665’ N, 90◦25.59125’ W) with the Pressure Core Tool with Ball Valve (PCTB) in its face-bit (FB) configu­ration. Shortly after collection, the cores were scanned using the Geotek Pressure Core Analysis and Transfer System (PCATS)33. The PCATS scan of core density, compressional wave speed and X-ray imagery are given in Fig. 1. In PCATS, compressional wave speeds, vp, exceeding 2000 m/s are generally associated with the presence of gas hydrate, and speeds above 2500 m/s generally indicate high gas hydrate saturations40. The silty sands at this site can have hydrate saturation of 80 % or more27. As described by Meazell et al.24 and captured at high-resolution in their  Fig. 5, the sandy silt lithology (3FB1 in Fig. 1) has internal structure and laminations observable in the original PCATS X-ray scans taken while Fig. 1. PCATS core scans of pressure core segments from 3FB1 and 4FB6. Density tends to be slightly higher in the fine-grained interbeds (4FB6 here), but the sandy silts (3FB1 here) have higher compressional wave speeds, vp, indicative of gas hydrate. I.

By comparison, the clayey silt lithology (4FB6 in Fig. 1) is generally without structure, but can contain thin layers of coarser-grained material that can be hydrate-bearing (e.g., there is a compressional wave speed spike in 4FB6 that appears as the light band between 7 and 8 cm in the X-ray scan). These two samples were selected for this study to represent the two endmember lithologies in the GC955 gas hydrate reservoir, but it is important to recognize the layer thicknesses at GC955 were often thinner than the cores shown in Fig. 1.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) transported two cores (3FB1 and 4FB6) at high pressure to their Coastal and Marine Science Center laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. For the two subsamples studied here, core sections were rapidly degassed over a few minutes, then retained in their liners and shipped to the Georgia Institute of Tech­nology (Georgia Tech) without hydrate and at atmospheric pressure. The subsection from 3FB1, which originally contained high gas hydrate saturations (compressional wave speeds above 2500 m/s in Fig. 1), was highly disturbed by dissociation during the rapid depressurization and did not preserve the original sediment fabric prior to study at Georgia Tech. The subsection from 4FB6 had essentially no hydrate (compres­sional velocities below 2000 m/s in Fig. 1) and is thought to have pre­served its original sediment fabric as it was tested at Georgia Tech. Grain size analysis of the two samples, using the laser diffraction method (Mastersizer 3000E), indicates that 3FB1 is sandy silt (SM) and 4FB6 is clayey silt (CM), as shown in Fig. 2. The grain size distribution of the two tested cores in this study (solid curves) is presented together along with that of other cores recovered from the same borehole but at different depths (dashed curves). Permeability results for these samples will be discussed in later sections. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the two samples are shown in Fig. 3. The sand and silt particles in both samples are angular with sharp edges, consistent with smear- slide imagery of angular sandy silt grains from this reservoir24. This morphology suggests extensive particle crushing and little to no reworking of the sediment prior to deposition. This is consistent with earlier findings that the GC955 silty sands experienced direct, rapid deposition15. Table 1 summarizes other fundamental physical and index properties of the samples. Liquid and plastic limits are measured using the fall cone method (BS 1377). The specific surface area is determined using the methylene blue method31. Even with only 2.4 % clay in core 3FB1 and 19.1 % clay in core 4FB6, the measured specific surface areas of the two cores are relatively high (Ss = 11.3 and 111 m2/g, respectively). 2.2. A customized water retention cell Water retention curves in sediments are obtained using a customized water retention cell (Fig. 4a), in which specimens are housed within a cylindrical ring (inner diameter of 48.85 mm or 1.9 in.), sitting on top of a ceramic disc with an air-entry pressure of 1.5 MPa. Gas with a pressure lower than this air-entry pressure will be retained in the cell and only water can flow across the ceramic disc. Before the test, the ceramic disc needs to be water saturated, placed at the base of the cell, and sealed using two O-rings (one at the bottom and one at the side) to prevent gas leakage through the peripheral and bottom boundaries of the disc. Sediments of core 3FB1 are oven-dried and then air pluviated into the inner ring with an initial void ratio of e0 = 0.67 to replicate in situ packing. Carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is used to flush the sample to replace the air in the pores and then water is injected to saturate the sample. Because CO2 is much more soluble than air in water, flushing using CO2 promotes full water saturation, and residual CO2, if any, can be dissolved in water after flushing. For core 3FB1, hydrate-bearing conditions are also tested. Here, tetrahydrofuran (THF) is used as a hydrate former. THF hydrate, which can be formed in the absence of a gas phase and at room pressure, has been previously used in physical property measurements as a suitable analog for methane hydrate18,48. In particular, THF hydrate has been shown to produce a pore-scale hydrate habit analogous to what is observed for methane hydrate in granular media21,34,37. Here, a solution of 17.3THF:82.7 H2O35 is used to achieve the in situ hydrate saturation Sh = 80 % consistent with the 79–93 % measured for these GC955 sandy silt layers27. The specimen is prepared using pluviation into the THF-water solution. The entire setup and experimental process are conducted within a walk-in environmental chamber (Darwin TH055) for precise temperature control of hydrate formation and dissociation. Thermocouples are placed within the sample and the environmental chamber to monitor temperature throughout the tests. Water-saturated specimens housed within the ring are placed on the ceramic disc before assembling the cell to make it airtight. During the test, air pressure is increased stepwise and the effluent water from the cell at each pressure is measured using a high-precision scale (Denver Instrument Company, TR-104). The pressurized air invades into large pores and drains the water in them first, because the needed air pressure to overcome capillarity is smaller in larger pores. As the applied air pressure increases, water in smaller pores can then be drained. This process is repeated until no more water drains with increased air pres­sure (i.e., reaching the residual water saturation), or the maximum gas pressure of 1.5 MPa is reached (i.e., beyond which gas will percolate through the ceramic disc and no longer displaces water in the sediments). For fine sediments like the interbed sample 4FB6 with much higher suction (capillary pressures), the customized water retention cell can only drain less than 5 % water before reaching the 1.5 MPa ceramic percolation pressure. Instead, the filter paper method (ASTM D5298) is used to determine its water retention curve, enabling capillarity mea­surements at much higher pressures that can reach much lower water saturations. 2.3. A customized permeability anisotropy cell Permeability measurements are made by using a customized permeability anisotropy cell (Fig. 4b). The cell is designed to test a cubic-shaped specimen, 35.56 mm (1.4 in) on a side. All four sides of the specimen are capped with porous stones, built within cell walls thick enough to generate less than 10-6 strain (i.e., considered as zero-lateral strain condition) under 35 MPa stress. There are two fluid injection ports, one on the top cap and the other at the side wall, for vertical and Table 1 Index properties of 3FB1, 4FB6, and literature data.

For each flow measurement direction, there are two effluent ports on the opposite face. The effluent ports are connected with two isolated porous stones, an inner circular one within an outer squared one, i.e., the ‘double-ring’ method (ASTM D3385 and ASTM D5093). The outer ring removes the rigid wall effects to avoid preferential boundary flow. Only the effluent water through the inner ring (25.4 mm or 1 in in diameter) is used to determine the permeability. Although the cross-sectional area of the specimen is 35.56 x 35.56 mm2 (1.4 × 1.4 in2), the actual area for permeability measurement in each direction is only the 25.4 mm diameter circular area of the inner ring. Using Darcy’s law, the perme­ability K is measured by creating a pressure difference ΔP across the sample using ISCO pumps and monitoring the corresponding flux Q through the inner ring: K = QLΔPAinμ,(1)  where L is the height/width of the sample for vertical/horizontal flow; Ain is the area of the circular inner porous stone for the inner flow; and μ is fluid viscosity. Note that the hydraulic gradient i across the sample is proportional to the applied differential pressure ΔP as i = ΔP/(Lγw), where γw is the unit weight of water. The horizontal and vertical permeability at each stress is not measured synchronously. When measuring the vertical permeability, all horizontal injection and effluent ports are closed, and likewise for horizontal permeability measurements. For core 3FB1, sandy silt recovered from a hydrate-bearing layer, both hydrate-free and hydrate-bearing conditions are tested. For the hydrate-free condition, the reconstituted specimen is prepared using water pluviation with an initial void ratio of e0 = 0.79, which reaches e = 0.57 (i.e., porosity n = 0.36) at the in situ effective vertical stress of 4 MPa. For the hydrate-bearing condition, the same procedure in the water retention test is followed to prepare the specimen with a hydrate saturation of Sh = 80 % and an initial void ratio of e0 = 0.79. Core 4FB6, recovered from a fine-grained reservoir interbed layer, is directly cut and placed into the permeameter to preserve in situ layering and texture. Only the hydrate-free condition of this core is tested, as it was hydrate- free in situ. After specimens are prepared within the permeameter, a series of vertical stresses of σv = 10, 100, 500, 1000, and 4000 kPa is applied, with the specimen’s vertical deformation measured using a linear voltage differential transformer (LVDT). At each stress level, both the vertical and horizontal permeability is measured at a hydraulic gradient of i = 10. Once the in situ effective vertical stress of 4 MPa is reached, the permeability is measured under an array of hydraulic gradients: i = 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 500 to investigate the impacts of the hydraulic gradient on measured permeability under this 4MPa stress only. The maximum hydraulic gradient of 500 is chosen as the middle range of the potential hydraulic gradients seen in reservoirs, which can vary from tens to thousands depending on the reservoir permeability (see Nankai Trough reservoir-based example in Section 4.3 and Fig. 10). To minimize hydrate dissolution due to fluid injection, the permeability of the hydrate-bearing sample is measured only under stresses of σv = 10 kPa and 4 MPa. 3. Experimental results 3.1. Water retention curves Fig. 5 shows water retention curves, given here in terms of the capillary pressure Pc, and water saturation, Sw, for tested specimens during the drainage process. For core 3FB1, an air pressure of 20 kPa is first applied until the drainage of the water out of the sample stops. This process is repeated for increasing applied pressures. The maximum applied air pressure for core 3FB1 is 400 kPa. Above 400 kPa, no additional drained water can be detected by the scale with an accuracy of 0.1 mg, suggesting the residual water saturation is reached at Srw = ~5 %. For the hydrate-bearing sample, an initial water saturation Sw = 0.2 is used as hydrate occupies 80 % of the pores in the specimen. The drainage of water continues until the water saturation reaches Srw = ~2 %. For the interbed core, the procedure in ASTM D5298 is followed to prepare five specimens with different water saturations. At the end of the equilibrium phase, the matric suction for each specimen is deter­mined by using the calibration curves for Whatman No. 42 filter paper19. The van Genuchten39 model is used to fit the water retention results to obtain the values of the gas entry pressure P0, the residual water saturation Srw, and the fitting parameter m for tested samples: Pc = P0[(Sw −Srw1 −Srw)−1m−1]1−m.(2) The Brooks and Corey3 model is also utilized to fit the data points to obtain the values of the gas entry pressure P0, the residual water satu­ration Srw, and the fitting parameter λ for tested samples: Pc = P0(Sw −Srw1 −Srw)−1λ.(3) The comparison between the experimental data points and the two models shows that the van Genuchten model captures the capillary characteristics of the samples more accurately, especially at high water saturation values. Although both models include three similar parame­ters to define the curve, the van Genuchten model uses a modified and more complex version of the Brooks & Corey model to fit the data points. The three parameters obtained from the models show that the smaller pores in the interbed clayey silt sample (4FB6) require higher pressure values to allow air to enter the sample, while the required air entry pressure is the lowest for the sandy silt core without hydrate (3FB1). A similar conclusion can also be made in terms of residual water saturation at the end of the drainage process. The clayey silt specimen (4FB6) is still approximately 10 % saturated even at high pressures, while the sandy silt (3FB1) drains to lower saturations even at lower pressures. For the hydrate-bearing case (3FB1-H), the pore network clogging due to THF hydrate results in a higher air-entry pressure than in the hydrate-free case. Also, the percentage of the water trapped in the pores is slightly higher in the hydrate-bearing case (10 % of the total water in the specimen) than in the hydrate-free case (2–5 % of the total water in the specimen) due to the same reason. 3.2. Permeability during consolidation Fig. 6a shows consolidation results for the 3BF1 (with and without hydrate) and 4FB6 cores. As the vertical stress increased from the initial 10 kPa to the in situ stress of 4 MPa, the total void ratio decreases in the reconstituted sandy silt core 3FB1 are Δe = 0.23 without hydrate and Δe = 0.08 with Sh = 80 % hydrate. For the intact interbed layer, the consolidation curve shows the pre-consolidation pressure of approxi­mately 2 MPa, and the total change in void ratio is Δe = 0.29 as the vertical stress increased from 10 kPa to 6 MPa. Correspondingly, the compression index of the interbed core is Cc = 0.44, higher than that of the sandy silt core without hydrate Cc = 0.13 and with hydrate Cc = 0.047. The recompression index for the interbed core is Cr = 0.021, similar to that of the hydrate layer core Cr = 0.025 without hydrate and Cr = 0.014 with hydrate. Fig. 6b shows the measured horizontal and vertical permeability in the tested samples, together with published (vertical) permeability measurements in cores recovered from the same site. Specifically, 4FB8, 7FB3, and 13FB1 are tested before and after methane hydrate dissoci­ation using the University of Texas pressure-core permeameter10. In addition, core 4FB8 (after hydrate dissociation) and a seal core 11FB1 are remolded and their vertical permeability is tested using a triaxial cell and a rigid-walled consolidation cell11. 3FB5 and 5FB3 are tested for I.

As expected, measured permeability decreases as the increased ver­tical effective stress reduces pore sizes. The presence of hydrate in the sandy silt core lowers the permeability by approximately a factor of 30 at the 4 MPa in situ vertical stress condition. For the hydrate-free reservoir core 3BF1, increased stress lowers both vertical and horizon­tal permeability to a similar extent. The permeability anisotropy remains nearly unchanged with increased stress Kh/Kv = ~ 1.5–1.6, possibly because this is a remolded sample with no evident sedimentation or lamination. When this reservoir core contains Sh = 80 % hydrate, the permeability anisotropy is Kh/Kv = 0.25 at 10 kPa vertical stress and eventually becomes less prominent (i.e., Kh/Kv = ~1) at 4 MPa vertical stress. However, the intact interbed core 4FB6 shows strong stress- dependent permeability anisotropy, Kh/Kv = ~1.56 at 10 kPa that became exponentially more prominent with increased stress to Kh/Kv = 0.0625 at 4 MPa (Fig. 6b). Although the horizontal permeability is slightly higher than the vertical permeability initially, which may be due to horizontal bedding, horizontal permeability decreases with increased stress much more substantially than vertical permeability, possibly because the effective void area perpendicular to the horizontal flow decreases with increasing stress while the effective void area perpen­dicular to the vertical flow remains nearly unchanged during vertical loading. Nonetheless, these results highlight that remolded samples can render the representative (vertical) permeability values of intact Fig. 6. Permeameter results.

The horizontal permeability of the sandy silt core 3FB1 is 24.3 mD without hydrate and 0.9 mD with hydrate (hydrate saturation, Sh = 0.8) at the in situ stress of 4 MPa.

Analyses and discussion 4.1. Pore size distribution Water retention curves play a crucial role in understanding the pore characteristics of a porous medium, including pore throat size distri­bution, connectivity, and spatial correlation. Measured capillary pres­sure Pc reflects the pore size rp through the Laplace equation Pc = 2Tscosθ/rp, where the air-water surface tension is Ts = 0.072 N/m. Assuming the contact angle is θ = 0◦, the pore size can then be estimated with known capillary pressure as rp = 2Ts/Pc. On the other hand, the amount of water contained in the pores corresponding to the calculated size rp can be determined by using the partial differentiation of water saturation with respect to capillary pressure ∂Sw/∂Pc, which indicates the frequency distribution of the pore size22. Therefore, the pore size distribution can be estimated from the van Genuchten39 model, as shown in Fig. 7. The pore size of the sandy silt core 3FB1 follows roughly a logarithmic normal distribution, with a pore size of ~2.5 µm at the peak probability. This is consistent with the mercury porosimetry measurements made on sandy silts from this reservoir9, which show a peak radius of 4.56 ± .52 µm. The formation of Sh = 80 % hydrate in this core shifts the pore size distribution leftward, i.e., reduces the overall pore sizes. Specifically, the probability of pore radii less than 1 µm in­creases, and pore radii larger than 1 µm become significantly less frequent. This may be due to hydrate formation partially clogging pores and dividing larger pores into multiple smaller pores. For the fine-grained interbed core 4FB6, the most likely pore radius is ~0.2 µm with a much wider distribution compared to the sandy silt core. This distribution confirms the reason for the highest air-entry pressure P0 and the lowest slope parameter m. 4.2. Relative and absolute permeability With known water retention curve parameters using the van Gen­uchten39 model, the relative water krw and gas krg permeability during the drainage process can be deduced (Fig. 8a): krw = S0.5[1 −(1 −S1m)m ]2krg = (1 −S)0.5[1 −S1/m]2m,(4)  where S = (Sw −Srw)/(1 −Srw) is the effective water saturation and m is the slope parameter. For the Brooks and Corey3 model, the equations for the relative permeability to water krw and to gas krg during the drainage process are (Fig. 8b): krw = S2+3λλkrg = (1 −S)2(1 −S2+λλ ),(5)  where λ is the fitting parameter. In the case of a hydrate-bearing spec­imen, the effective water saturation is S = (Sw −Srw−Sh)/(1 −Srw−Sh). In Fig. 8a, the results show that gas flow dominates the hydrate-free sandy silt sediments when S < ~0.75, the hydrate-bearing sandy silt sediments when S < ~0.65, and the interbedded clayey silt sediments when S < ~0.85. Note that the effective water saturation S describes the water volume relative to the effective pore volume (i.e., volume without hydrate, not the total pore volume). In addition, relative permeability curves derived from the Brooks & Corey model (Fig. 8b) do not show substantial differences among these three specimens, possibly because the Brooks & Corey model, compared to the van Genuchten model, does not fully capture the water retention curves, especially in the high water saturation regime (Fig. 5). By combining the water retention curves (Fig. 5) and the relative permeability curves from the van Genuchten model (Fig. 8a), a perme­ability function showing the capillarity-permeability relationship can be determined. To convert from relative permeability (Fig. 8) to phase permeability in Fig. 9, we multiply the relative permeability to water (or gas) by the absolute permeability for each core at the in situ vertical effective stress of 4 MPa and under a hydraulic gradient of i = 10 (See Fig. 6 caption). The results in Fig. 9 show a critical capillarity of approximately 200 kPa, below which the water flow is dominated by the sandy silt (3FB1) specimens, and higher than which the fine-grained interbed layer can transport more water mainly because the coarse- grained layer has almost been drained at this capillarity while the fine-grained layer is still nearly water saturated. On the other hand, the sandy silt (3FB1) layer remains the dominating gas flow pathway regardless of the capillary pressure in the system (Fig. 9b). Fig. 7.

Impacts of the hydraulic gradient Fig. 10a presents the measured permeability in the sandy silt 3FB1 core with and without hydrate, both at 4 MPa vertical effective stress, but with different hydraulic gradient conditions. Results show that an increased hydraulic gradient can lower the permeability by one order of magnitude from i = 10 (recommended by ASTM standard) to i = ~500. For the i = 500 hydraulic gradient, the corresponding water injection pressure is approximately 0.17 MPa, which may induce local compac­tion of the sediments, as well as increased flow velocity that increases flow tortuosity and friction. The effect is important to consider because the hydraulic gradient near the production wellbore can be much larger than i = 500, partic­ularly for reservoirs with low intrinsic permeability.

Permeability in hydrate-bearing sediments dictates gas and water flow rates and needs to be accurately evaluated. Published permeability studies of hydrate-bearing sediments mostly quantify vertical permeability; however, the flow is mainly horizontal during gas production in layered reservoirs. Additionally, ASTM stan­dards require a hydraulic gradient of 10–30 to be used during laboratory permeability measurements, but the gradient is much higher in the field, particularly near a production well. To address these issues, this study focuses on the hydraulic properties of a sandy silt subsample of the hydrate reservoir and a clayey silt subsample of the fine-grained, hydrate-free interbed recovered from a GC955 deep-water Gulf of Mexico gas hydrate reservoir. We characterize the sediment pore space with water retention curves for both hydrate-free and hydrate-bearing samples (hydrate saturation, Sh =80 %). Vertical deformation with increasing stress is also quantified while consolidating the samples to the 4 MPa in situ vertical effective stress. The customized per­meameter measures both the horizontal and vertical permeability with increasing stress. Results show that high hydraulic gradients lower permeability in the flow direction, possibly due to increased flow tortuosity and local sediment compaction from the high seepage force. Assuming a single permeability value, even though hydraulic gradients decrease with distance from the well, is not realistic for field estimations. The results highlight that permeability anisotropy, hydrate saturation, stress conditions, and hydraulic gradient all substantially impact reservoir permeability during production.   1. Introduction Methane gas trapped in hydrate has the potential to contribute to natural gas supplies in the future2. The characteristics of hydrate-bearing sediments play a meaningful role in the gas production rate and economic feasibility of tapping these reservoirs as energy re­sources, however5. As an example, for reservoirs with permeability K =0.1milliDarcies (mD) and 10 mD respectively, the high-permeability reservoir has a peak gas production rate that is 1.8 times that of the low-permeability reservoir during its lifetime1. Permeability, particu­larly how it evolves during production, has been shown to be one of the most crucial properties of hydrate-bearing sediments governing the economic feasibility of gas production from hydrate deposits around the world25,26,41. The permeability of hydrate-bearing sediments can be measured in situ using downhole logging tools such as the nuclear magnetic reso­nance (NMR) or the express pressure tool (XPT). NMR quantifies the permeability through empirical relations based on the NMR relaxation time13. The XPT method determines the permeability of the formation by decreasing pressure in the borehole and observing its recovery by water flow16. The development of pressure core technology in recent decades has made it possible to measure permeability in natural sedi­ments with preserved hydrate29,32. Reported permeability data include pressure cores from the Nankai Trough16,29,30,42,43, the Indian Ocean14, 28,44, the South China Sea20, the Gulf of Mexico10,47, and the Alaska Northern Slope45,46. Complementary laboratory permeability measure­ments use these natural sediments with synthesized methane or tetra­hydrofuran (THF) hydrate for parametric studies, such as to gain * Corresponding author.

Fig. 5c-d depict the recovery factor (RF) across different pressures. For the depleted single-phase gas reservoir in which CO2 injection fol­lows (scenario A-S), the RF is about 60% at a pressure of 1670 psi while for the piston-like mode the RF is almost 75% with a stabilised pressure of about 2520 psi. In the case of condensates, the recovery factors are calculated individually for dry (red line), wet (black line) and conden­sates (green line) for the two scenarios (see Fig. 5d). Higher recovery is achieved in piston-like injection (almost 70% for condensates) against the case where the reservoir is depleted first and then CO2 is injected (40% for condensates). The dry gas recovery fluctuates around the same levels (70–75%) across the two scenarios, while the wet gas recovery is 75% in B-C against the 60% in A-C. In scenario A-C the three phases of gas are more scattered. The RF is much higher in both single phase and condensate gas for scenarios B (B-S and B-C) since less gas is trapped as the water invades the reservoir while the pressure is maintained enhancing production. Fig. 5e-f present the drive indices for the two scenarios (A, B) for both types of reservoirs (S, C). In scenarios A-S and A-C, only the water influx and the gas drive indices do exist. The water drive reaches a proportion of 35% for scenario A-C against the 30% for the same scenario in single phase gas A-S. The contribution of water-drive mechanism is negligible compared to the gas expansion drive at the beginning of the production period, hence most of the gas is produced by depletion of the reservoir. As the production continues, the water invades in the formation and the water-drive mechanism becomes significant reaching an approximate median value of 30%. In the piston-like case (scenario B-S) all drive indices are included (namely, the water drive, the CO2 drive and the gas drive). The same appears to hold for the piston-like scenario as before (as the production goes on, the water drive makes its presence while at the beginning the gas drive mechanism is in place), however, both the two indices are less dominant compared to the CO2 drive index which starts at around 60% for single phase gas and 70% for condensates and remains at these levels throughout the production. The three drive indices show that in piston-like mode the dominant mechanism is CO2 injection which seems to act against water influx (minimizing it onset and propagation) while its value is fairly stable across the injection event. In the absence of CO2 injection, the water influx increases as the pressure in the reservoir reduces but the gas expansion is the dominant drive mechanism. 5.2. Sandstone reservoir for various cases In this section various initial reservoir pressures (2000, 3000 and 4000 psi) and production rates (10, 50 and 100 MMSCF/d) are consid­ered for sandstone formation and for both single phase (A-S, B-S) and condensate gas (A-C, B-C), to assess the effects of reservoir pressure and production flow rate. First, the single-phase gas results are presented, followed by the findings of condensate gas and then the findings are compared. 5.2.1. Single phase gas Fig. 6 presents the results obtained for initial pressures of 2000, 3000 and 4000 psi and production rates of 10, 50 and 100 MMSCF/d for single phase gas for both depletion – scenario A-S (Fig. 6a, c, e) and piston-like modes – scenario B-S (Fig. 6b, d, f). Generally, the P/z interquartile curves are narrower for the piston-like behaviour for all initial pressures and flow rates. If the CO2 is injected in a depleted reservoir with a higher initial pressure, higher production rate leads to lower P/z values and breakdown points signifying higher gas produc­tion. This trend with respect to flow rates, although present in the piston-like behaviour, it is less evident. The RF factor is higher if the flow rate increases for the case of depleted sandstone reservoirs. This trend fades out as the initial pressure increases in the case of piston-like behaviour (Fig. 6c-d). In the first case (A-S), the RF increases as the pressure of the reservoir decreases. However, in both cases the pro­duction is lower. Once again, this is more pronounced in the case of injecting carbon dioxide in a depleted reservoir. For higher production rates, the reduction rate of the GDI and hence the increase rate of the WDI is at a lower rate (Fig. 6e-f). The CDI is independent of the pro­duction rate but it appears to be higher in very low initial pressures. 5.2.2. Condensate gas Fig. 7 presents the results obtained for initial pressures of 2000, 3000 and 4000 psi and production rates of 10, 50 and 100 MMSCF/d for condensate gas for both depletion – scenario A-C - (left figures) and piston-like modes – scenario B-C (right figures). As previously, the P/z interquartile curves are narrower for the piston-like behaviour for all initial pressures and flow rates (even narrower compared to the case of single-phase gas). If the CO2 is injected in a depleted reservoir with a higher initial pressure, higher production rate leads to lower P/z values and breakdown points. In condensate gas no correlation is observed between initial pressure and RF. The RF factors, though, of wet and dry gas are higher if the initial pressure is lower for the case of depleted sandstone reservoirs. No similar trend is shown in the case of piston-like behaviour. For higher production rates, the reduction of the GDI and hence the increase of the WDI is at a lower rate. The CDI is independent of the production rate and it appears to be higher in very low initial pressures. The results suggest that a good strategy to increase NG RF is to produce at higher rate in order to lower the pressure faster than the aquifer flow can advance. In the presence of water influx, the RF per­forms worse. This is mainly due to the generation of residual gas which is essentially trapped in the invaded by water area. As shown in this study, a higher production rate leads to a P/z Vs. Gp curve closer to the line where there is no water influx, leading to more production. The recovery factors also show that in the piston-like behaviour are independent of the production rate while they are weakly dependent on the initial reservoir pressure. This is because of the dominance of the CDI. In lower initial pressures it is almost the sole drive index while at higher pressures it becomes independent of the values. As the flow rate increases the WDI becomes less significant in single-phase and condensate gas but also in both depletion and piston-like modes. The initial pressure does also have an effect on the findings as the higher it is, the more the water invasion is present. 5.3. Various formations for the baseline case In this section, shale and unconsolidated formations are examined against the baseline case (initial pressure at 3000 psi and production rate of 50 MMSCF/d) for piston-like and depletion cases and for single phase and condensate gas (scenarios A-S, A-C, B-S, B-C). The main dif­ferences between the three types of formations examined are the range of porosity values and more predominantly the range of permeability. Shales have much lower permeability whilst unconsolidated formations tend to have much higher porosities and permeabilities compared to sandstones. 5.3.1. Unconsolidated formations Fig. 8 shows the results obtained for the baseline case for unconsoli­dated formations for the single phase gas (scenarios A-S, B-S) (a, c, e) and for condensate gas (scenarios A-C, B-C) (b, d, f). The production of single- phase gas via the piston-like mode injection is profoundly higher (almost 1000 BSCF against 580 BSCF for the depleted reservoir case - Fig. 8a). The same is observed in Fig. 8b for condensates in which the difference is higher (1250 against 650 BSCF). There is also 30% difference in the RF between injecting in the depleted reservoir and piston-like injection favouring once again the latter mode of CO2 injection. There is almost no pressure drop in the reservoir as seen in Fig. 8c-d, and this was expected as the permeability of this type of formations is very high. This also explains M. Giakoumi et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ```"

In such high porous materials, highly ‘conductive channels’ already exists for gas to sweep. This porous network is likely to be interconnected since it has such high porosity values. As a matter of fact, the permeability is very high which supports easier flow. At the same time, the presence of an aquifer supports pressure maintenance as it propagates substantially through the formation, and it is a significant drive mechanism (see Fig. 7e-f). In the absence of such mechanism the pressure drop due to depletion would be very high and rapid. Wet, dry and condensates pro­duction coincide in both condensate scenarios (A-C, B-C).

Under the current initial pressure and production rate, CDI is higher in the case of condensates. The effects of the water influx are much lower and are almost non-existent in shales as shown in both single-phase and condensate gas (Fig. 9e-f), due to the very low permeability which in­hibits the water invasion. It can be safely concluded that the two driving mechanisms are the CDI and the GDI. 5.3.3. Comparisons across the three formations As expected, the gas production was found to be higher in uncon­solidated formations while shales present the lowest gas production. The pressure depletion to produce the gas increases substantially in the case of shale while for unconsolidated formations this remains very small. For both ‘extreme’ cases there are other problems associated with pro­duction. For shales, such high-pressure depletion is unrealistic, and therefore in practise another ‘driving mechanism’ is introduced to enhance production, such as hydraulic fracturing to generate conduits and increase the surface area for gas or oil to flow. At the same time at such high-pressure drops, mixing of CO2 and CH4 is expected to be very high. Nonetheless, an independent analysis of the economic aspects of the separation process may suggest that it is feasible to permit significant pressure drops, depending on the extent to which methane can be effi­ciently separated from the rising levels of injected CO2.71 For uncon­solidated formations, the main problem is sand production which relates to the strength and cohesion between the grains in the formation. Since this is low, the particles dislocate and move generating problems in the production unless well completion with sand control is used. Water from the aquifer invades the formation to a greater extent in unconsolidated formations because of their higher permeability which allows more easily the movement of the fluids within the formation without substantial reservoir depletion. The opposite appears in shale which has very low permeability; the WDI is essentially zero for both single-phase and condensate gas but also for both depletion and piston- like modes. 6. Conclusions A screening tool for carbon dioxide injection in single-phase and condensate gas reservoirs under water influx with the use of the material balance equation was presented in this work. The framework presented in this study could be used for designing carbon dioxide injection pro­grams in both depleted reservoirs or as part of an enhanced recovery scheme. Various options for CO2 injection in a depleting reservoir whether injecting CO2 after producing natural gas or injecting CO2 to displace NG from the reservoir were investigated. Results show that in the latter case, the piston-like displacement method, is more efficient as the three evaluation indices show that in piston-like mode the dominant mechanism is CO2 injection which seems to act against water influx (minimizing its onset and propagation) while its value is fairly stable across the injection event (more controlled as the interquartile range of produced gas at a given pressure is smaller meaning the process is less sensitive to the formation porosity and permeability). The recovery factors also show that in the piston-like behaviour are independent of the production rate while they are weakly dependent on the initial reservoir pressure. This is because of the dominance of the CDI. Finally, the combination of permeability and porosity in sandstones is the ideal for such operations given the fact that very low permeability leads in poor recoveries whilst higher permeability leads to problems related to the strength of the formation such as drilling instabilities and sand production.

This approach, rooted in physical laws, can be easily adjusted to incorporate multiple features, while the results typically provide a representative assessment of the reservoir’s performance, eliminating the need to introduce complexities such as reservoir in­homogeneity. Furthermore, MBE allows for the introduction of any fluids that maybe present such as the injection of water, nitrogen or even the injection of carbon dioxide.39,40 In order to perform a material balance analysis for a CO2 injection program, it is necessary to consider the volume of carbon dioxide injected into the reservoir (both the volume of carbon dioxide that is injected directly into the reservoir and any additional volume that is created as a result of the injection (e.g. due to the expansion of the gas) and the volume of carbon dioxide that is stored in the reservoir as a result of the injection. This information can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the injection and to identify any potential issues or challenges that may arise. MBE has been used to estimate the storage efficiency of CO2 in depleted reservoirs or saline aquifers.41–43 A modified MBE framework for CO2 injection in depleted reservoirs for single-phase gas and condensates has been presented by 39 Lawal and Frailey (2004) 39. Although the authors do not include water influx, they argue that condensates vaporize. Very recently, a modified MBE equa­tion for CO2-EGR injection in single phase gas reservoirs has been developed which considers the reservoir under ‘static conditions’ since it monitors pressure changes and focuses only on the carbon dioxide in­jection pressure, rather than the overall reservoir performance.44 This paper introduces a novel screening tool that solves a modified material balance equation which is specifically tailored for gas reser­voirs. The equation incorporates the sequestration of carbon dioxide along with water influx, considering various production rates and pressure states. The novelties of this work are:  1. The simulation of the two distinct scenarios (injection in depleted reservoirs and the piston-like injection) with water influx. The piston-like scenario accounts for enhanced gas recovery for which very little work has been conducted previously. The function to be solved becomes highly non-linear due to the introduction of the water influx model and the constraint of the abandonment condition (where production stops). In this paper, a new abandonment con­dition has been developed to identify the production limit.  2. The application of the same equation in both dry and condensate reservoirs without any further modifications with the use of a two- phase Z factor for the case of condensates.  3. The use of Monte Carlo simulations to account for heterogeneities within the reservoir which are usually introduced by the formation characteristics (porosity, hydraulic conductivity). The first scenario, labeled as scenario A – GDP-CS (Gas Depletion by pressure, Carbon Storage), considers the depletion of the gas reservoir alongside carbon dioxide injection, aimed at reaching a targeted final reservoir pressure. The second scenario, scenario B – CS-GDQ (Carbon Storage, Gas Depletion by CO2 injection), involves the depletion of the gas reservoir while injecting equal moles of carbon dioxide in a piston- like injection manner.45 The MBE of the latter scenario has not been presented previously nor was solved numerically. The presented tool can be modified accounting for various fractions of CO2 over natural gas moles. By evaluating the expected gas and condensates recovery factors, as well as the efficiency of CO2 storage and final pressures, a comprehen­sive comparison of the three rock-type cases is presented. Various met­rics are proposed for the reservoir performance assessment which could be used for any fluid injection scheme. 2. Mathematical framework for CO2 injection The material balance equation (MBE) is a method that can be used to account for the movement of reservoir fluids within the reservoir or to the surface where they are produced and accounts for the fluid produced from the reservoir through expansion of existing fluid, expansion of the rock, or the migration of water into the reservoir. It includes factors that compare the various compressibilities of fluids, considers the gas satu­rated in the liquid phase, includes the water that may enter into the hydrocarbon reservoir from a connected aquifer or any injecting fluid. This section presents the various parameters chosen for the analyt­ical solutions and the modified material balance equation which was derived to estimate and evaluate the different CO2 injection scenarios. First, the mathematical framework for CO2 injection is presented, fol­lowed by the assumptions of the conceptual model. Then, the selected water influx model (Carter-Tracy water influx model) is shown. The derivation of an abandonment condition model which is another ma­terial balance equation is presented, followed by the choice of compressibility factors for condensates which enables the use of a common modified MBE for the solution. Fig. 1(a) is a schematic demonstrating the stages for scenario A – GDP-CS (Gas Depletion by pressure, Carbon Storage). Gas is produced by pressure reduction with water influx (phase I) and then carbon dioxide is injected for storage. It is assumed that the invading water is not pushed backwards during injection given that water is an incompressible fluid. Fig. 1(b) shows scenario B – CS-GDQ (Carbon Storage, Gas Depletion by CO2 injection) with water influx. In this technique, CO2 is injected into the reservoir, and it behaves like a piston, pushing and displacing natural gas toward production wells (mol-to-mol displacement). As the CO2 moves through the reservoir, it can help enhance the flow of natural gas by adding another reservoir driving mechanism, making it easier to extract and produce from the reservoir. The solution when considering mol-to-mol injection of CO2 and displacement of natural gas becomes complicated, however, such formulation enables the use of various ra­tios of moles of CO2 injected over moles of natural gas produced. Uniform displacement of fluids across the reservoir is assumed for this model. The piston-like displacement model assumes that the injec­tion and production takes place across the whole height of the reservoir at flow rates high enough for the inertia terms to dominate over the buoyancy terms. Also, no dispersion between CO2 and CH4 is assumed as in such supercritical conditions the recovery is found to be very high.46 Gravity effects cause the dense CO2 gas to flow downward while the lighter CH4 migrates upward which would also act against mixing conditions.47 2.1. Deriviation of the modified MBE for CO2 injection The first scenario (Fig. 1(a)) which considers the depletion of the gas reservoir and subsequent injection of carbon dioxide is a two-step pro­cess and therefore two different MBEs are considered. The general ma­terial balance equation for a natural gas reservoir, at a target pressure Pn at time tn(with negligible water and formation expansion, without water production) for a gas reservoir of initial pressure Pi is given by Eqs. 1a and 1b. The term for CO2 injection is included only in Eq. 2 as first the reservoir is depleted and then CO2 is injected. G(BNGgn −BNGgi)+ Wen(tn, tn−1, Wen−1, Pi −Pn) = GpnBNGgn(1a)  Ginj = VHC(1BCO2gn−1BCO2ga)(SCF)(1b)  where G is the initial reservoir natural gas volume at surface conditions, Ginjn is the CO2 injection volume, Wen is the cumulative water influx, Gpn is the cumulative produced gas and VHC is the initial hydrocarbon reservoir volume. The terms Bgn and Bgi are the formation volume factors defined as the volume of gas at reservoir pressure and temperature required to produce one standard volume of gas at standard conditions (T = 60oF & P = 14.7psi) at the surface. The second scenario involves the depletion of the gas reservoir while M.

As shown in Fig. 1(b), carbon dioxide is injected while the natural gas is produced. The MBE, at a target pressure Pn at any time tn(with negligible water and formation expansion, without water production) for a gas reservoir of initial pressure Pi takes the form of G(BNGgn −BNGgi)+ GinjnBCO2gn + Wen(tn, tn−1, Wen−1, Pi −Pn) = GpnBNGgn(2) The reference reservoir has a lateral extend area A, thickness h, and porosity φ.

Gas compressibility factors For condensates, the concept of the two-phase gas deviation factor was introduced 48,49. When the reservoir pressure decreases below the dew point pressure, the gas condenses and forms a liquid hydrocarbon phase while a significant volume of this condensate is immobile and remains in the reservoir. Therefore, correct application of the material-balance concept requires consideration of liquid volume remaining in the reservoir and liquids produced at the surface. The mathematical representation of such case is GB2gi =(G −Gp)B2g. Fig. 1.

The water influx model The term Wen(tn, tn−1, Wen−1, Pi −Pn) which corresponds to the cu­mulative water influx requires an approximation of the aquifer behav­iour. The Carter-Tracy water influx model was formulated and used in this work because of its extensive use in gas reservoirs.50,51 The Carter-Tracy technique assumes constant water influx rates over each finite time interval and hence the cumulative water influx at a specific time is calculated based on the water influx of the previous step as follows: (We)n = (We)n−1 +[(tD)n −(tD)n−1][BΔpn −(We)n−1(p′D)n(pD)n −(tD)n−1(p′D)n](7)  where, n, refers to the current time step and n-1, refers to the previous time step, Δpn, is the total pressure drop, pi–pn in psi, pD is the dimen­sionless pressure, p′D is the dimensionless pressure derivative. The term B is the van Everdingen-Hurst water influx constant defined as B = 1.119φctr2eh θ360(7a)  where θ is the angle subtended by the reservoir circumference (e.g. for circular reservoir θ = 360), ct is the total compressibility of the aquifer, φ is the porosity and re the effective reservoir radius.

For the values of the dimensionless pressure pD as a function of tD the approximation by Edwardson et al.

The abandonment condition In the presence of an aquifer, the flow rate, the pressures and hy­draulic properties of the formation limit the natural gas production down to a pressure state termed as the end-point in production. This is located at the intersection between the End-Point Line and the produc­tion curve (hydraulic model) as shown in Fig. 2. This is considered to be the abandonment condition. For scenario A, where the reservoir is first depleted and then CO2 is injected, the equation is derived from a third material balance equation, as described by Agarwal et al. (1965),50 where the maximum gas re­covery equals to the initial gas in place minus the trapped gas (residual gas), minus the gas in regions not swept by water, though unavailable to production because of breakthrough of water into all existing producing wells. Gpm = G[1 −Ep{SgrSg+ 1 −EpEp} PmZiPiZm](8)  where the factors Ep is the Volumetric Displacement Efficiency, Sg is the initial gas saturation and Sgr is the residual gas saturation.Zi is the notation for the deviation factor of the Natural Gas at initial conditions (T,Pi). Pm, Gpm, Zm refer to a point m of the end-point line. Rearranging Eq. 8 gives, PmzNGm=(Pi/zNGi )Ep[Sgr1−Swi + 1−EpEp] −(Pi/zNGi)GEp[Sgr1−Swi + 1−EpEp]Gpm(9) The End-Point line equation (Eq. 9) is shown in Fig. 2 by the yellow line. At the intersection of the End-Point Line and the hydraulic model curve (blue curve), production stops since water encroached into the tubing faster than the gas. In this case, the terms Pm, Gpm, Zm become Pa,Gpa, Za since the adandonment condition is obtained. For scenario B, where piston-like behaviour is assumed, a new ma­terial balance equation for the end-point line is derived to account for the fact that water influx has lesser effects. The two terms that are deducted from the initial gas in place which are the trapped gas (residual gas) and gas in regions not swept by water are multiplied by a scaling factor reflecting the lower effects of water drive mechanisms. The scaling factor is a ratio of the water influx for given reservoir and for­mation conditions for piston-like behaviour over the water influx for given reservoir and formation conditions for depletion mode (Wpiston−likeWdepletion). Therefore, the third MBE described by Eq. 9 becomes: Gpm = G[1 −Wpiston−likeWdepletionEp{SgrSg+ 1 −EpEp} PmZiPiZm](10) And rearranging gives, PmzNGm=(PizNGi)Wpiston−likeWdepletion Ep[Sgr1−Swi + 1−EpEp] −(PizNGi)Wpiston−likeWdepletion GEp[Sgr1−Swi + 1−EpEp]Gpm(10a) This equation offsets and changes the slope of the original End-Point line as proposed by Agarwal et al. (1965) 50, for depletion of the reservoir without fluid injection (Eq. 9). 3. Numerical implementation and performance analysis The developed screening tool is shown in Fig. 3. First the desired mode of injection is selected (scenario A or Scenario B). Then, the appropriate MBE needs to be derived along with the choice and deri­vation of various other relevant parameters (water influx mode, compressibility factors of single phase gas and condensates, derivation Fig. 2. The abandonment condition is defined by the cross section of the hy­draulic model curve (blue curve) defined by a material balance equation and the end-point line- Eq. 9 (yellow line). M.

The modified MBE needs to be solved by numerical analysis and therefore a simulation engine which solves a root-finding function for pressures in each time step of production is defined and presented in this section. The simulation engine which includes the root-finding function to be solved is chosen to follow a probabilistic approach. In an attempt to quantify uncertainty, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted account­ing for heterogeneity of the reservoirs. The uncertainty is introduced in the input parameters which either very greatly within the reservoir or are in most cases uncertain estimations. This is an important element of such analysis as it could provide at any stage a range of values in terms of performance linking the findings to the associated risks. Finally, per­formance analysis is conducted to assess the efficiencies of the overall performance of the injection event. 3.1. Root-finding function The unknown parameter that must be determined to estimate the performance properties in both Eqs. (1) and (2) is the targeted reservoir pressure Pn. Since the deviation factors z and the water influx model are also a function of Pn, numerical iterative methods must be applied. Therefore, a root finding function, F is constructed in each scenario in order to determine the targeted reservoir pressure: F(Pn) = 0(11) In this study due to the complexities involved in differentiating the function F, primarily, the bisection method 53 is proposed as the nu­merical method for solving Eq. (10) at each pressure step. For the simulated case studies presented in the subsequent sections, the ‘fzero’ function from MATLAB 54 was utilized to minimize calculation time. This function employs a hybrid approach, combining the bisection method with other numerical methods. For scenario A, the root finding function becomes, F(Pn) = GzNGnPn+ Wen(tn, tn−1, Wen−1, Pi −Pn)0.0282T−GzNGiPi= 0,(12a) For scenario B, the function is constructed based on material balance but with the term Ginjn set equal to the cumulative gas production at the Fig. 3.

Probabilistic modeling of the scenarios The previously defined scenarios can be estimated following a deterministic approach. This approach involves averaging the input parameters (e.g., porosity) or defining the best parameter estimates and using the scenario’s model to predict a single best estimate for the sta­bilized pressure for each production step (tn). However, this method fails to provide an understanding of the solution’s uncertainty, which is crucial for assessing the uncertainty and for informed decision-making in the designing carbon dioxide injection programs. To address these shortcomings, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to estimate the stabilized pressure with a defined uncertainty profile.55–57 The ‘simulation engine’ includes the identification of the MBE so­lution for every time step or production step until reaching the aban­donment condition where production stops under various scenarios (condensates or single-phase gas, depletion or piston-like mode injec­tion, various formation properties, pressures, and production rates). Finally, the outputs of the Monte Carlo experiments were stored and statistically processed to present the P/z versus Gp diagram and the performance metrics against pressure. 3.2. Performance analysis The performance metrics are generally used to assess the quality of the reservoir. For the case of CO2 injection the relevant metrics are: RFn = GpnG , GDIn =G(BNGgn −BNGgi)GpnBNGgn, CDIn =GinjnBCO2gnGpnBNGgn, WDIn =WenGpnBNGgn(14)  where, RFn is the recovery factor at targeted pressure Pn (applicable to wet gas, dry gas & condensates with their corresponding volumes), GDIn denotes the Gas Drive Index, CDIndenotes the CO2 Drive Index, and WDIn denotes the Water Drive Index at targeted pressure Pn.. 4. Case study 4.1. Formation properties Three formations have been considered in this investigation, sand­stone, shale and unconsolidated materials. The main formation param­eters that are of interest and are related to the methodology presented in this work are porosity and permeability. Permeability depends mainly on porosity but also on other parameters such as pore geometry and clay content, etc. However, many empirical relationships exist that relate permeability only with porosity provided that they describe specific clean formations. The values for porosity were derived from Manger (1963),58 which tabulated more than 900 items of porosity for sedi­mentary rocks found in various locations. Empirical relationships for permeability for each formation are based on Pape et al. (1998).59 For sandstones the relationship used is: k = 31φ + 7463φ2 + 191(10φ)10(nm2)(15) For shales, the relationship is k = 0.1φ + 26φ2 + (10φ)10(nm2)(16) Finally, for unconsolidated materials the relationship used is the one of Fontainbleau sandstone which was found to be in the range of weakly cemented sandstones or soft sandstones describing adequately uncon­solidated materials 60–64: k = 303(100φ)3.05(nm2)(17) In the case study, Monte Carlo simulations have been carried out based on the available porosity values and statistical characteristics to assess the performance of the models across the various metrics. 250 numerical experiments have been conducted for each scenario under examination which were proven to converge. Both scenarios A and B have been investigated with water influx for the three formations. 4.2. Inputs of the case study The performance for a gas reservoir was computed for a reservoir of area A = 5000 acres and thickness h = 100 ft surrounded by an infinitely-large aquifer. Detailed reservoir and aquifer characteristics selected are presented in Table 1. The selected values were inspired by Agarwal et al. (1965) and Craft et al. (1991) 50,65 which represent field data. The performance was evaluated (beyond porosity and perme­ability) for a range of reservoir production rates (10, 50, 100 MMSCF) and initial formation pressures (2000, 3000, 4000 psi). The pseudo-critical properties of natural gas and carbon dioxide are depen­dent on chemistry composition and the critical properties of each component. The pseudo-critical properties are the apparent properties of the mixture. In this case, pseudo-critical pressure and temperature are used, for example, in determining the compressibility factor (Z). The gas deviation factor is selected in a different way based on whether the gas is dry or wet. For dry gas the pseudo-reduced properties were first calculated form the pseudo-critical properties (Tpr =TTpc and Ppr = PPpc) and then the gas deviation volume factor was estimated.66 The function that relates the pseudo properties with the gas deviation vol­ume factor is based on Hall and Yarborough (1973)67 which introduces the reduced density root-finding function. 66,68 The model was prepared as a MATLAB function using the Newton Raphson method 53 to aid the calculations and to provide more accuracy.

Often, a significant volume of this condensate is immobile and remains in the reservoir. Therefore, correct application of the material-balance concept requires consideration of liquid volume remaining in the reservoir and liquids produced at the surface. The mathematical repre­sentation of such case is GB2gi =(G −Gp)B2g. Apart from the two-phase gas deviation factor, the Gals Per MSCF (GPM) and Residue gas oil ratios (GOR) are required to fully define the problem to calculate the amount of condensates (GPM(Pn) × Gpn)and the amount of dry gas (GOR(Pn) ×GPM(Pn) × Gpn)in the wet gas. These values were taken from field pressure volume temperature (PVT) data from Craft et al. (1991) 65 and fits were generated to expand the values to the intermediate pressures as shown in Fig. 4. 5. Results and discussion Results for both scenarios are presented. In Scenario A (depletion, water influx) for both single-phase gas (A-S) and condensates (A-C), first the reservoir is left to deplete and then CO2 is injected in the depleted reservoir. In Scenario B (piston-like mode, water influx), the same vol­ume of produced natural gas at standard conditions is injected as carbon dioxide volume with mol-to-mol displacement (B-S for single phase gas and B-C for condensates). First, a base line case for sandstone is assumed in which the pro­duction rate is 50 MMSCF/day with an initial reservoir pressure of 3000 psi. Then, simulations are conducted with various flow rates and initial reservoir pressures. Finally, for the baseline case the results of the three formations are compared. 5.1.

The continuous line is the median line of the various Monte Carlo experiments that were performed while the dashed lines represent the interquartile range. The two curves have an end point, which shows the point where production stops due to water influx. For scenario A-S, the ratio P/z reduces down to approximately 1850 psi with produced gas of about 300 BSCF, while for scenario B-S the ratio goes down to about 2800 psi with 375 BSCF produced, showing that CO2 supports the maintenance of pressure to a great extent leading to higher gas pro­duction (in scenario B-S, the CO2 injection stabilizes the pressure at a Fig. 4.

Carbon geological storage involves the storage of CO2 permanently in a subsurface reservoir, commonly a brine saturated aquifer, or a depleted reservoir. Carbon dioxide is also injected for enhanced oil or gas recovery (EOR/EGR). This work applies a material balance to CO2 for injection and storage in a single-phase dry and/or condensate gas reservoirs. The developed framework based on piston- like displacement can be either used for pressurising depleted gas reservoirs with CO2 or for EGR. Sensitivity studies of carbon dioxide injection in pressure depleted gas reservoirs and piston-like injection under water drive are presented for various production rates and initial reservoir pressures. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted for combinations of porosity and permeability of different formations such as sandstone, shale, and unconsoli­dated sand. The results show that CO2 piston-like injection in EGR is more efficient compared to first depleting the reservoir and then injecting CO2 as it controls the water influx. The recovery factors in CO2 EGR are almost insensitive to initial pressures and production rates for both single-phase and condensate gas. Higher perme­ability formations are much more effective, however, a formation with very high permeability may lead to stability problems.   1. Introduction Carbon dioxide sequestration is an emerging technique in the oil and gas industry due to its potential environmental benefits. It involves the capture and pressurised injection for storage of CO2, a greenhouse gas, in geological formations.1,2 Typically, the technique is applied to enhance oil recovery in a reservoir (carbon capture, utilisation and storage -CCUS) or to just store CO2 permanently underground (carbon capture and storage- CCS) with the main storage issues being the injectivity, capacity and containment.3 Carbon dioxide can be injected in a variety of subsurface formations, including sandstone, shale, and carbonate reservoirs. The injection method depends on the specific characteristics of a reservoir, mainly the porosity, permeability and the presence of an aquifer. Most of the previous related studies have been focusing on injectivity and containment including applications related to the delivery method of the carbon dioxide,4 to the chemical reactions in the reservoir, such as the formation of hydrates, 5 the geochemical interactions between the injected fluid-CO2 and rock,6–9 the effects of molecular diffusion and adsorption mechanisms on injectivity and storage amount,10,11 the CO2-brine-rock interaction,12–15 other geomechanical effects related to stresses such as sand migration, fracturing, fault activation, seismic events and pore scale modeling 16–19 or even on the economical perspective.20 Very few studies have been focusing on the capacity or pressure management of a reservoir during CO2 injection.21,22 The approaches followed to reveal the underlying mechanisms for applications related to CO2 injection beyond experimental works,23 are analytical,24,25 numerical simulations,26–30 volumetric,31,32 based on production history data,33,34 or even probabilistic methods and machine learning were applied.35–38 The material balance equation (MBE) is a key concept in the analysis of carbon dioxide injection programs. It refers to the volumetric balance between injected fluids into the reservoir and the amount of fluids (carbon dioxide, gas, oil, water) that are produced or stored as a result of * Corresponding author.

Rather, it tries to simulate a sta­tistical reproduction of measured value ranges by means of variance and mean value. Since there is not a detailed analysis of the dry density of the bentonite sample, measured stresses and pressures are used for the implementation of the heterogeneity. The variance of the Young’s modulus is derived from the stress measurements and the gas entry pressure is derived from the observed gas entry into the bentonite. The stress measurements at the beginning of the experiment (Fig. 3) are approximately between 7 MPa and 8.5 MPa. Assuming a linear rela­tionship between measured stress and Young’s modulus, a standard deviation of 0.27 GPa can be calculated. The mean value for the Young’s modulus is 3.5 GPa. A Gaussian normal distribution is assumed for the distribution. For the distribution of the gas entry pressures, the measured gas pressures are analysed at which gas first enters the bentonite and at which the main part of gas enters. The first inflow is measured at a gas pressure of 7.3 MPa, while the main inflow occurs at 9.8 MPa (Fig. 7). From this, a mean value for the gas entry pressure of approx. 10 MPa and a standard deviation of 2 MPa are determined. Dilatant pathways are modelled by including the strain-dependent intrinsic permeability relationship developed in37. k = f(εvol)eb1εpk0(3)  where f(εvol) ={10b2εvol, εvol ≤0(&compaction)10b3εvol, εvol > 0(&extension)(4) with εvol (-) being the volumetric strain, εp (-) being the equivalent plastic strain, k0 (= 5 ×10−20 m2) being the initial intrinsic permeability tensor and b1, b2 and b3 being empirical parameters controlling flow that need to be calibrated against experimental results. In particular, pa­rameters b2 and b3 account for the increased flow velocities in the case of microfissuring, which might be observed when the gas pressure is still lower than the minimum principal stress and tensile strength whereas b1 is used to define a rapid increase of permeability once the tensile failure is reached. The volumetric strain is 0 at the beginning of the simulation. Maximum permeability increments triggered by volumetric strain and plastic strain are at a factor of 100 each. That is, a theoretical increase in intrinsic permeability of 10,000 can occur at high volumetric and plastic deformations. However, it should be noted that the model is only vali­dated for small plastic deformations and only small deformations can be realistically calculated with the finite element method. The prescription of their values is difficult and the sensitivity analysis performed to simulate the test will be discussed in the following section. The higher permeability paths are triggered by the heterogeneous distribution of Young’s modulus, which is expected to result in a non-uniform strain development. Its mean needs also to be empirically calibrated and de­tails about the sensitivity analysis performed to simulate the test are also reported in Section 4. 3.1.2. Model geometry and numerical software A finite element method (FEM) 2D model has been developed to analyse the test described in Section 2. The open-source software OpenGeoSys (OGS - version 5.8) has been used, see.38 To simulate the test, a triangular 2D axisymmetric mesh has been used, see Fig. 14. In this current phase of the DECOVALEX project, the injector (assumed rigid) has been explicitly modelled by means of the addition of a source term (whose value needs calibration against experimental measurements) that allows the simulation of the increasing pressure. It is defined by a high porosity (= 0.5) and a high permeability value (=1 ×10−17 m2). Relatively low values have been chosen here for the injector material, to reduce numerical issues at the boundary between the injector and the bentonite. However, in relation to the bentonite permeability, the intrinsic and relative permeability combined are around 1010 higher. 3.1.3. Initial and boundary conditions The sample has been considered to be initially saturated (initial value of 97%) by assuming an initial capillary pressure of 2.0 MPa. First, a constant gas pressure of 3.0 MPa has been prescribed to account for a water pressure of 1 MPa (as dictated by the sorption equilibrium equa­tion, see39). An initial compressive effective stress of 7.0 MPa (in each direction) has been defined to account for the swelling stress reached by the material during saturation. No displacements are prescribed at the boundaries including the central borehole, see Fig. 14. Injection pressure is prescribed at the bottom of the injector material group whereas backpressure is pre­scribed at the upper boundary. 3.2. Model developed by LBNL 3.2.1. Conceptual model This model builds upon LBNL’s experience previously gained during Task A DECOVALEX-2019 (D-2019) since, as part of D-2019, LBNL developed and numerically applied two different approaches: a multi­phase flow model (i) combined with additional hydro-mechanical fea­tures and (ii) coupled to a discrete fracture modelling approach,40. Indeed, for the current phase of DECOVALEX-2023, LBNL enhanced their homogeneous continuum approach, which is based on the linking of the multiphase fluid flow simulator TOUGH2 with the commercial FLAC3D geomechanical code thus enabling the simulation of processes characterised by strongly-coupled flow and geomechanics. Key features of this current enhanced continuum approach are:  • Constitutive relations for the hydraulic behaviour: as done by BGR/UFZ, the van Genuchten formulation is used to define the water retention curve. Relevant capillary pressure parameters for the bentonite are adopted from.41 In this model, Corey model is adopted for the description of the relative permeabilities of gas and water. Fig. 14.

That is, σ’ = σ −pϕI(6)  where again, σ’ and σ are the effective and total stress tensors respec­tively, I is the identity tensor and the pore pressure pϕ is defined as pϕ = max(pl, pg)(7)  with pl and pg liquid and gas phase pressures respectively. As in D-2019, this model assumes a fracture-like behaviour of the flow path. Hence, a stress dependent permeability function k = kmatrix + b3h12a(8) is again considered, where a [m] is the element width and bh [m] is a non-linear function of the effective minimum compressive stress that reads bh =bh01 + 9(σn−Pσn,ref)(9)  with bh0 (m) being the (calibrated) maximum aperture for permeability, σn (Pa) the total stress normal to the fracture and σn,ref (Pa) the adjusted reference stress normal to the fracture. In these simulations, the total normal stress to the fractures is taken as the minimum compressive stress. The aperture versus pressure relationship of Eq. (9) corresponds to the model described in43 and its parameters need to be calibrated by matching pressure and outflow responses observed in the experiments, see Section 4 for more details. To be able to simulate the abrupt gas breakthrough response, the concept of a constant effective gas entry pressure has been adopted by LBNL. As done by BGR/UFZ, a heteroge­neous gas entry pressure might be considered in future approaches, together with heterogeneous porosity and permeability fields. 3.2.2. Model geometry and numerical software The simulator applied in this study is the TOUGH-FLAC code,44 that combines the TOUGH2 multiphase flow simulator45 with the commer­cial geomechanics code FLAC3D.46 TOUGH2 enables the simulation of multiphase fluid flow and heat transport based on the integral finite difference method whereas FLAC3D is a finite-difference code that al­lows the representation of geomechanical features. Similar to other TOUGH-based geomechanical simulators, the two codes are sequentially coupled: in particular, fluid flow variables (such as pore pressure and saturation) calculated by TOUGH2 are transferred to FLAC3D, which then computes effective stresses and associated deformations, returning updated values for the stress-dependent permeability. The selection of small time-steps is important to find stable solutions of the hydraulic and mechanical response: a maximum time step of 1 day is here prescribed while smaller time-steps (e.g., 100 s) are automatically calculated by TOUGH2 for convergence in the multiphase flow calculations around the gas breakthrough. This is the main computational challenge that arose when running simulations: during abrupt changes in saturation and permeability (at the instant of gas breakthrough) time steps were reduced to very small values for convergence in the sequentially coupled hydro-mechanical solution process. To simulate the test described in Section 2, a quadrilateral 2D axisymmetric mesh has been used, see Fig. 15. The use of an axisym­metric model allows to obtain simulation results within a reasonable time (on the order of 20 min) by employing relatively small number of elements and nodes, see Appendix A.3. However, it is inherently limited to the analysis with homogeneous material properties, thus meaning that heterogeneous properties and flow paths cannot be rigorously considered. To properly consider heterogeneous material properties, a full 3D model would be required. As seen, the injector is explicitly modelled considering a represen­tative volume of the injection chamber. For the simulations, gas is injected by prescribing its injection rate (in kg/s). This value needs to be calibrated by fitting the pressure increment in the injection chamber against the observed pressure increments. 3.2.3. Initial and boundary conditions The sample and the injection chamber have been considered to be fully initially saturated (2 MPa water pressure). A backpressure of 1 MPa has been also assumed and an initial stress of 8.0 MPa has been defined. The sample is mechanically confined during the entire simu­lation: no displacements normal to the boundaries are prescribed. A no- flow condition has been assumed at the boundaries, except at the in­jection and outflow filters. Fig. 15.

Model developed by CIMNE-UPC/Andra 3.3.1. Conceptual model This model is built on the work carried out by CIMNE-UPC/Andra within the previous phase of the DECOVALEX project, see,26 where a coupled hydro-gas-mechanical 3D numerical model was developed assuming a heterogeneous initial permeability field and embedded fractures.47 This approach is characterised by the following key features:  • Constitutive relations for the hydraulic behaviour: in the model developed by CIMNE-UPC/Andra, the retention curve is defined by the van Genuchten model. In this case, the retention curve may change with the opening of the embedded fractures as pore size controls the gas entry values, and fractures may represent large pores leading to a reduction of the gas entry value. Relative permeabilities are also assumed to be fracture-dependent to account for preferential paths. This is achieved by assuming that the relative permeability, which is a function of the effective degree of saturation, is decom­posed into matrix and fracture terms, as discussed in the following paragraph. • Constitutive relations for the mechanical behaviour: deforma­tion is modelled assuming elasticity with net stress (fluid pressure as the maximum between gas and liquid). A dilatancy term (ψ angle) is added in the deviatoric component of the volumetric strains Δεv = Δp’K −Δq3G tanψ(10)  Δεd = Δq3G(11)  where p’ and q correspond to the net mean stress and deviatoric stress invariants, and K and G to the bulk and shear modulus, respectively (compression positive). As done by LBNL, net mean stress is defined as total stress minus Biot’s coefficient times fluid pressure (maximum between gas and liquid pressures), see Eqs. (6) and (7)7.  • Hydro-mechanical coupling: in the proposed approach, it is assumed that the mechanical constitutive model and the perme­ability model are coupled but independent. That is, the mechanical behaviour is coupled to the hydraulic/gas because the volumetric strains cause changes in permeability, through changes in aperture. To account for the preferential paths, a constitutive model based on an integrated embedded permeability is employed. The strategy is based on the decomposition of the intrinsic permeability into a matrix and a fracture intrinsic permeability kint = kmatrix + kfracture(12)  which undergo respective variation with porosity and aperture and read kmatrix = k0(1 −ϕ0)2ϕ30ϕ3(1 −ϕ)2(13)  kfracture = b312a(14) where k0 (m2) is the initial permeability (randomly distributed along the material); ϕ0 (=0.44) is the initial porosity; ϕ (-) is the current porosity value, changing in space and time during the test; a (m) refers to the internal associated width for each fracture (which is equivalent to the assumed spacing between fractures) and b (m) is the aperture of the fractures. This value depends on the strain ε (-) and on the initial strain ε0 (-) and may be computed as b = b0 + 〈ε −ε0〉a ≤bmax(15)  with b0 (m) and bmax (m) being the initial and maximum aperture of the fractures. Liquid- and gas-phase permeabilities are also decomposed into matrix and discontinuities or fractures terms. These read kliquid =(Seff, liquid)nliquid(kmatrix + kfractures)(16)  kgas =(Seff, gas)nmatrixgas kmatrix +(Seff, gas)nfracturesgaskfractures(17)  respectively, with Seff, liquid/gas (-) being the saturation degree for liquid or gas and nmatrix/fracturesliquid/gas (-) being a power for each case state (i.e., for liquid or gas state, and for matrix or fractures media). As previously stated, liquid and gas relative permeabilities are defined by the effective saturation degree of liquid and gas respectively.

Model geometry and numerical software The computer software CODE_BRIGHT48 has been used to carry out the numerical simulations. CODE_BRIGHT is a finite element-based code developed at the Universitat Polit`ecnica de Catalunya - BarcelonaTech (DECA-UPC) and the International Centre for Numerical Methods in Engineering (CIMNE). To simulate the test of Section 2, a 3D hexahedral mesh has been developed, see Fig. 16. As seen, the 3 mm-thick base (F1 and F2) and backpressure filters have been considered. The injector has been explicitly modelled, assuming all relevant components (i.e., injection rod and injection filter tip), Fig. 16[A]. Additional global features of the injection/pumping system device (i.e., interface vessel, pipework, etc.) have not been considered but they have been represented through an equivalent volume factor applied to the injection filter. A detailed sensitivity analysis regarding the volume of the injector has been per­formed. As in previous Task A D-2019, calculations have been per­formed by considering a heterogeneous medium, where three different sample zones have been assumed to be randomly distributed, see Fig. 16 [B]. This produces heterogeneity of permeability and the retention curve. It is worth noting that mesh size is always a numerical challenge when modelling hydro-mechanical process and thus, the choice of the mesh involved a compromise between simplicity on the one hand and the capability of representing heterogeneity on the other.49 Fig. 17.

Initial and boundary conditions The sample has been considered to be initially water saturated. First, no initial stress was considered. After experimental dataset was released, an initial stress of 8 MPa has been assumed, corresponding to the swelling stress reached by the material during saturation. Boundary conditions have been prescribed so that they reflect the constant volume boundary test features. A no displacement condition (in any condition) is assumed at all the boundaries. This includes the sample-injection rod and filter contact. Once experimental results were released, refined boundary conditions (a refined injected gas flow ramp) have been considered, thus improving the numerical curves. 4. Results The capabilities of the three numerical models (BGR/UFZ, LBNL and CIMNE-UPC/Andra) have been assessed by comparing the simulated results against the experimental ones obtained from the laboratory. In particular, the following time histories were specified to be re­ported and are the key features of the comparison exercise:  1. Radial stresses curves in the 16 sensors (from R1 to R16).  2. Axial stresses in the 8 sensors (from A1 to A8).  3. Pore pressures in the 2 filters (F1 and F2).  4. Gas saturation profiles in the 24 sensors (from R1 to R16 and from A1 to A8)  5. Inflow into the system and outflow curves (at STP). However, the teams were not asked to explicitly include the behav­iour of the sensors used to measure changes in the stress within the bentonite sample. This has no bearing on the validity of the model outputs as sensor deformations were on the micron-scale (orders of magnitude below the models’ scales). Some teams did include the rep­resentation of the injection system to improve model predictions. A visual inspection of the experimental data (see Fig. 17) indicates that experimental radial and axial stresses can be summarised by four key components: (i) a quiescence phase, followed by (ii) the gas breakthrough, which leads to a (iii) peak value, which is then followed by (iv) a negative decay. Radial and axial stress results are shown in Fig. 18 and Fig. 19 respectively. As seen:  • Quiescence phase: all teams obtain good initial values.  • Rapid transition phase: reasonable responses are obtained after the modelling work performed during the study. However, some teams still predict a too-smooth response. Other key specific features (such as the breakthrough timing) still require a better representation. Indeed, the rapid stress increment is in general earlier modelled than experimentally observed.  • Peak values: they are in general reasonably-well captured. Maximum radial stress differences are observed at 48 mm from the base of the sample, where numerical peak values of 12.8 MPa are predicted by both BGR/UFZ and CIMNE-UPC/Andra, whereas experimental values are about 11 MPa (15% overprediction). • Negative decay: models are capable of giving a reasonable repre­sentation of the negative decay. Some simulations should have been run for a little longer in order to analyse whether the steady-stage phase is finally captured. Similarly, as with stresses, a visual inspection of the pore pressure data (Fig. 20) indicates that:  • Quiescence phase: some teams obtain good initial values, although others underpredict the initial stage. • Rapid transition phase: in general, this remains a difficult experi­mental feature to capture. In some models, the response is too slow and the breakthrough is captured at earlier times than seen in the Fig. 19.

This is most likely a numerical diffusion effect and necessary to get gas into the sample.  • Peak values: reasonably good peak values are obtained with the three models.  • Negative decay: the post-peak shape trend is well defined by all models. Again, the steady-stage phase is not numerically observed, as simulations have not run for sufficient time. Inflow and outflow curves were also analysed. As seen in Fig. 21[A], some modelling teams used the experimental inflow as a boundary condition whereas others modelled the change in volume of gas based on the injection pump rate to determine the pressure from the ideal gas law. Thus, the analysis of the inflow modelling results makes it difficult to carry out a direct comparison. Fig. 21[B] shows the outflow results. The model developed by LBNL is capable of obtaining good fits with respect to both the abrupt increase in fluid flow and its timing. Other curves either show an earlier (BGR/UFZ) or a later (CIMNE-UPC/Andra) peak, whose value is overpredicted (almost a factor of 2 was observed). The observed shape of the post-breakthrough curve, which shows a shut-in behaviour and is directly linked to the stress state, is poorly reflected by all the models. This suggests a better understanding or representation of the hydro-mechanical coupling is still required. As a summary, although the numerical approaches are not able to describe the full complexity of the physical processes, they are capable of matching key aspects of the evolution (e.g., peak values, breakthrough-timings, decay). The fact that some of the requested out­puts are well represented without necessarily obtaining a good match to the entire dataset suggests that some of the underlying conceptual models are more/less sensitive to the individual couplings that appear in the system, and therefore that different models may be better/worse at representing selected aspects of the system evolution. It is also worth noting that these numerical fits were obtained after a calibration process. Indeed, the adjustment of model parameters (see Appendix A) is needed and detailed sensitivity analysis are required. Their determination is extremely cumbersome (with no guarantee of uniqueness) since although each parameter primarily controls a partic­ular effect with respect to the global response, all of them are correlated due to the very pronounced coupling between the hydraulic and me­chanical response. These calibrated models lead to some calculated properties, such as gas saturations, being beyond physically reasonable values, suggesting the physical description of the system remains incomplete. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 22, some high gas saturation profiles are obtained by some models. As also seen, BGR/UFZ saturation profiles are nearly constant throughout the simulation. This limitation is due to the fact that this model assumes that the pore fluid in the bentonite is located in the intra-aggregated pore spaces and therefore, it does not change much during the gas flow experiment. Indeed, the stochastic distribution of the gas entry pressure (see Section 3.1) is the responsible mechanism for the variability of the saturation in the bentonite. The shown time series data are obtained in single points (at the sensors) and thus, categorical conclusions cannot be drawn. That said, post-test measurements yielded no measurable gas saturations within the sample as a whole. Therefore, high gas saturation profiles suggest that either the model capillary relationship governing desaturation is incorrect or too many pathways (with too high permeability) are present in the model. 5. Discussion This paper presents a summary of a new gas injection test undertaken at BGS and the subsequent work performed in Task B of the current phase of DECOVALEX (DECOVALEX-2023) in which 4 teams have developed hydro-mechanical approaches for the modelling and repre­sentation of dilatant-controlled advective gas flow through very low- permeability materials. Validation against a one-dimensional gas test subjected to a constant volume boundary condition was performed by three of the teams. The experimental data from this gas injection test exhibits a combination of deterministic (e.g., breakthrough after a period of increasing gas pressure, bulk gas flow through a main emer­gent pathway) and stochastic (e.g., precise timing of the gas break­through, associated gas pathways) behaviours. It is therefore important for any analysis to distinguish between the key experimental features reproducible across all experiments and those that only occur in specific experiments. This study allowed teams to test initial models and codes against a new dataset to verify the robustness of their predictions and thereafter enhance them in order to include the main deterministic features observed in these gas injection tests. To this end, other high-quality experimental datasets would be useful to help build additional confi­dence in the understanding of the key processes governing gas flow, the continued development and verification of numerical models, and the representation of these complex processes across different repository scales. BGR/UFZ developed a hydro-mechanical model that included a pressure-dependent intrinsic permeability and an elasto-plastic hetero­geneous porous medium. It is able to correctly capture initial and peak Fig. 21.

LBNL applied a contin­uum approach, with a direct relation between permeability and least principal effective stress, that models dilatant permeability increase once the local fluid pressure approaches the least principal stress, i.e. the least principal effective stress approaches zero. This approach along with a gas entry pressure that is scaled with the dilation-induced permeability can be used to simulate the macroscopic gas flow behav­iour (Figs. 18 and 19), although the model is not fine enough to capture microscopic dilatancy and heterogeneous gas channelling. The observed shape of the post-breakthrough curve, which shows a shut-in behaviour and is directly linked to the stress state, is poorly reflected by all the models thus suggesting a better understanding or representation of the hydro-mechanical coupling is still required. New conceptual models may therefore need to be developed to explain this complexity (Ap­pendix B). However, their development is still in a very preliminary phase and at the current stage of the work, they are not able to reproduce the experiments. Thus, from a pragmatic perspective, enhanced flow models remain the only viable tool to represent these systems at this time. In summary, this study illustrates further analyses are needed for a better understanding before models can be used, with confidence, as a predictive tool to assess advective gas movement:  • Parameter calibration and model constraints: developed models need calibration of fitted parameters. This poses a computational challenge as a large number of simulations are required. In addition, their adjustment is a complex task: indeed, although it is possible to evaluate the main effect of a single parameter on the global response, several parameter correlations exist due to the complex model cou­plings. A great effort from the modelling teams has been made to tackle this issue and detailed sensitivity analysis have been carried out to characterise the one-dimensional gas injection test. However, their extrapolation to other tests can be difficult. This was already observed in Task A D-2019,21 where different parameter values for the 1D and the 3D tests were sometimes arbitrarily prescribed. Thus, more numerical analyses and a better understanding of the complex couplings within the codes are needed before the models could be used with confidence as a predictive tool to assess gas movement.  • Heterogeneity: the role of material heterogeneity needs to be further explored, as it has shown that it might provide a possible way to represent flow localisation. Indeed, some teams have assumed heterogeneous fields (e.g., permeability, gas entry pressure), as the introduction of heterogeneity at the capillary scale is not practicable. However, the assumed distribution functions are usually arbitrary prescribed and lack a physical justification. In the absence of data (e. g., characterisation of pore morphology, variation in material prop­erties), this issue remains a challenge for all teams. • Stochasticity: experimental data exhibits a combination of sto­chastic and deterministic behaviours. Despite the growing awareness of the need to reflect non-deterministic process features, developed approaches in this study are purely deterministic and hence, it is therefore important for numerical modelling to consider how best to account for key stochastic features such as the number of gas path­ways, the precise timing of the gas breakthrough and the associated gas flows.  • Upscaling: although this paper presents a summary of the modelling work performed when simulating laboratory-scale experiments, models that are tractable at the engineered barrier and repository scales are needed. Due to the need to accurately and efficiently include small-scale heterogeneities in a field-scale model, this poses a major challenge and will constitute the main aim of the next stage of the D-2023 project. In this forthcoming stage, the modelling of a full- scale in situ test (Lasgit) will be undertaken. This is a highly instru­mented test based on a mock canister, encapsulated in bentonite/ pellets, and placed within a deposition hole at the ¨Asp¨o underground research laboratory (Sweden). At the current stage of the modelling study, substantial future work is needed to account for some of the foreseen complexities (e.g., representation of the heterogeneous porous field-scale domain and the inclusion of the interfaces, since they play an important role). However, the expansion of the nu­merical approaches to a full-scale test will provide an invaluable insight to help to inform the modelling approaches and assess the impact of upscaling of gas flow on repository layout and therefore the design of any future facility.  • Application: the validity of these models for the prediction of gas flow in repository systems remains limited. Upscaling the detailed processes represented in the current models would be computa­tionally challenging, requiring compromises in both mesh density and simplification, or, averaging of less important processes. How­ever, it is important to remember that models need only to be fit for their application, so long as end-users clearly understand their de­ficiencies. Any changes/simplifications to the models would require experimental validation where possible and be derived from a detailed understanding of the importance/relevance of key phenomenological features. 6. Conclusions Different numerical representations for the quantitative description of advective gas flow in clay-based repository systems have been developed. This study shows that models that were used to simulate particular controlled-laboratory experiments (Task A in the D-2019 project) can be employed to reproduce other tests, even with different sample geometries. This study has also shown that these numerical approaches can successfully represent some of the main deterministic experimental features typically observed in dilatancy-controlled gas flow (e.g., initial and peak stress values). However, there are other features that are not correctly captured (e.g., rapid transition phase seen at breakthrough). This suggests that numerical models still lack a correct description of the full complexity of the physical processes observed in water-saturated experiments. This study has identified three key learning points that need to be born in mind when numerically modelling gas flow through water saturated low permeable clay samples:  1. Model calibration: models need calibration of fitted parameters. Each model needs a specific calibration process and thus, their adjustment requires detailed sensitivity analysis. Since gas flow is semi-stochastic by nature, these analyses should distinguish between Fig. 24. Buoyant rising of a less viscous fluid within a more viscous fluid. Image is taken from [B.4]. E.

Instead, heterogeneous ma­terial distributions can be used to implicitly represent preferential pathways.  3. Model coarsity: developed models are not fine enough to include microscopic dilatancy or heterogeneous gas channelling.

Appendix B. new theoretical model developed by SNL SNL developed an alternative approach to describe the key features observed in gas-laboratory tests that distinguish clay-rich media from other rock-types. The new model expands the work performed in [B.1], where a phenomenological concept of nonlinear dynamics and deterministic chaos theory was employed to analyse the gas pressure and the gas influx and outflux obtained from a one-dimensional test performed on a pre-compacted Mx80 bentonite sample at the British Geological Survey. Indeed, the computation of a set of diagnostic parameters [e.g., global embedding dimension, correlation dimension, information dimension, spectrum of Lyapunov exponents (B.1. and references therein)] suggested that the prevailing processes during the gas test are (i) chaotic diffusion both at the onset of gas influx and during the final phase of the experiment and (ii) chaotic advection after the breakthrough. The time series analyses of the data indicate that the observed chaotic behaviour of the system can be described by 3–5 independent variables. Here, focus is placed on the development of a conceptual model for such chaotic systems. A detailed mathematical formulation and analysis will be provided elsewhere. The primary research focus of the SNL team within the current D-2023 project is to understand the actual mechanism(s) for the emergence of the observed complex behaviour of gas migration in water saturated compact bentonite. In particular:  • Channelling postulate: although gas migration in a porous medium is generally treated as an immiscible displacement process within a “rigid” solid framework, this is unlikely to be the case for hydrated compacted bentonite, where the pore size is generally extremely small (on a scale of nanometers). Indeed, the capillary pressure pc in such a medium can be estimated by E. Tamayo-Mas et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ```"

Typical values of these parameters (σ = ~70 mN/m, θ = ~40◦, r = 1 - 10 nm, see [B.2] and [B.3]) lead to a significantly higher pc (~10 - 100 MPa) than the gas pressure generally used in experiments and therefore, given the low tensile strength of bentonite, the only possible way for gas to move through such a medium is by channelling.  • Channelling description: this channelling process is mathematically analogous to the buoyant rising of a viscous fluid within another viscous fluid, [B.4]. This allows the characterisation of both the spacing of channels λ = 2πL131/3( μ2μ1)1/3(20)  and the perturbation growth of the interface ξ =2ΔPgL13(L1 + L2)μ2( μ224μ1)1/3(21)  where μ1 and μ2 are the viscosities of gas and water-saturated compacted bentonite (Pa⋅s) respectively, ΔPg (Pa) is an externally imposed gas pressure gradient and L1, L2 (m) are the lengths defined in Fig. 23[A], characterising the compressibility of the bentonite, which is in turn related to the swelling pressure of bentonite as a function of the dry density of the material. As seen in Eq. (20), the spacing of channels only depends on the viscosity ratio μ2/μ1 and the length L1. Hence, the number of channels to be developed in the system is determined by the viscosity ratio only, see Fig. 23[C]. Moreover, it is interesting to note that the spacing of channels is linearly proportional to the length L1, implying that the channeling mechanism is linearly scalable. In other words, the complex fluid flow behaviour in gas migration in bentonite observed in small-scale experiments can probably occur in a large-scale experiment in the field, as highlighted by the multiple gas tests experiments performed within the Lasgit project.  • Gas breakthrough postulate: SNL postulates that the breakthrough point of gas migration corresponds to the time when a fully percolating channel network is established across the material domain. One important constraint on the establishment of such networks is that the gas pressure must be high enough to make enough room for gas percolation by compressing the bentonite matrix. The room available for gas migration is directly determined by the swelling capacity of the material and the dry density used in the testing, and thus the breakthrough pressure is around the swelling pressure. Since this room is usually a small fraction of the total material volume in a test, the apparent gas saturation degree is ex­pected to be small.  • Gas movement postulate (after the channel network is created): as experimentally and theoretically shown in [B.4], if the upwelling material has greater viscosity than the surrounding material, the structure is a long vertical column with gradually decreasing diameter and, if the upwelling material has less viscosity than the surrounding material, the structure envelops a rim syncline and a pronounced overhang and eventually ascends as a spherical pocket of fluid fed by a pipe, see Fig. 24. Analogously, and due to the large contrast in viscosity between the bentonite matrix and the gas injected, SNL postulates that gas percolates through a water saturated bentonite matrix in the form of individual gas bubbles. The size of bubbles is determined by the apparent surface tension of the gas-bentonite interface.  • Gas movement description (after the channel network is created): previous work carried out by SNL in [B.5] uses a logistic map model to describe the movement of a gas bubble in a deformable clay matrix which can display a complex dynamic behaviour that can be explained with a bifurcation and chaos concept. Indeed, the dynamic behaviour of the system has been shown closely related to clay matrix dilation, fracturing and fracture healing as induced by gas bubble movement. Therefore, these components should be included in any model describing the advective movement of gas through low-permeability materials.  E.

There is now a substantial body of evidence, spanning multiple decades, indicating that in these mate­rials, gas migration occurs through the creation of dilatant pathways rather than by moving within the original porosity of the clay as con­ceptualised in Darcy’s law.10–19 These pathways interact with the sur­rounding clay mass to introduce a complex hydro-mechanical coupling.15, 17, 20 Understanding these processes is essential to accu­rately modelling repository gas migration and to assess its long-term impact on the safety function of the EBS. To this end, multiple researchers have recently developed new nu­merical algorithms within the framework of Biot’s consolidation theory, where features such as damage, plasticity, embedded fractures, etc., have been considered to include or explicitly represent dilatant gas flow in clay-based materials.20–26 All these models are capable of capturing some of the main response features observed in laboratory studies, but they do not appear to effectively reproduce all of the main experimental observations that characterise dilatancy-controlled flow. Indeed, although most of them can satisfactorily simulate specific experimental features such as breakthrough time, maximum pressure/stress mea­surements and the dilation of the sample, there remain difficulties when trying to match the whole experimental history. Features such as the evolution of stress during and after breakthrough or the temporal vari­ations in gas outflow are not well reproduced.21 Other features such as the improvement of parameter calibration procedures, the further development of spatially- and temporally-dependent processes and the inclusion of pathways that behave highly dynamic and unstable, still remain uncertainties and thus, development of new and novel numerical representations for the quantitative treatment of gas in clay-based re­pository systems are still required. This was the primary focus of Task A in the DECOVALEX-2019 (D-2019) project,21 in which 8 teams from around the world attempted to model advective gas flow in 1D and 3D experiments performed on compacted bentonite samples under controlled laboratory conditions.15, 27 In Task A D-2019, four types of modelling approaches were developed: (i) two-phase flow models incorporating a range of different mechanical deformation behaviours, (ii) enhanced two-phase flow models in which fractures were embedded within a plastic material (continuous techniques) or incorporated into the model using a rigid-body-spring network (discrete approaches), (iii) a single-phase model incorporating a creep damage function in which only gas flow was considered, and (iv) a conceptual approach used to examine the chaotic nature of gas flow. In contrast to previous inter­national gas projects such as EVEGAS28–30 or GAMBIT,31–33 where some model parameters were heuristically adjusted to overcome the poorly characterised couplings between the stress field and gas and water pressures, the D-2019 models featured more robust hydro-mechanical couplings based on pre-defined physical quantities. However, some of the important underlying physics (e.g., creation of dilatant pathways) associated with advective gas flow were poorly described and therefore unable to represent the full complexity of the processes in these low-permeability materials. Several concerns were raised in Task A D-2019 as some key features in the modelling of advective gas were still unclear:  1. Parameter calibration and model constraints: model complexity was significantly different among the proposed strategies and some models were clearly over-parameterised. Marked differences were also found in the calibration outcomes. Indeed, both the number of the calibrated parameters and the experimental outputs used to calibrate them were significantly different between teams. While, Fig. 1.

Advective-gas-flow-in-bentonite--Development-and-c_2024_Geomechanics-for-Ene.pdf,"media/Advective-gas-flow-in-bentonite--Development-and-c_2024_Geomechanics-for-Ene.pdf:```Geomechanics for Energy and the Environment 37 (2024) 1005283some of these parameters (e.g., tensile strength, swelling pressure etc.) had a clear measurable physical meaning, others (e.g., damage smoothing coefficients, capillary spacing etc.) were numerical con­structs which had an indirect physical meaning and were often un­measurable. Hence, their definition was complex and their extrapolation to other tests was found to be difficult thus hampering the use of models as predictive tools to assess gas movement.  2. Heterogeneity: two models included explicit representations of material heterogeneity, but the assumed distribution functions were arbitrary. Heterogeneity might provide one possible route to repre­sent localisation of flow in continuum models but the distribution functions could not be physically justified and thus, teams concluded that further exploration was required.  3. Stochasticity: the experimental data from the 1D and the 3D gas injection tests exhibited a combination of stochastic and determin­istic behaviours. Gas breakthrough (identified by the discharge of gas at the backpressure filter, see Fig. 1) occurred after a period of increasing gas pressure, when bulk gas flow was observed through the development of an emergent pathway. The instability and pathway switching observed in the 3D experiment before a main flow path was established, suggested that the precise timing of the gas breakthrough and associated gas flows could be semi-stochastic in nature. It is therefore important for a deterministic analysis to understand and distinguish between the key experimental features reproducible across all experiments and those that only occur in specific experiments. Therefore, being able to analyse and model similar high-quality experimental datasets was required to help give confidence in process understanding.  4. Upscaling: numerically upscaling (from laboratory to field scale) poses significant challenges, which go beyond the current study. However, a future companion paper will address these issues based on an examination of a full-scale test undertaken at the ¨Asp¨o Hard Rock Laboratory, Sweden. With these concerns in mind, it was concluded that enhanced nu­merical representations for the quantitative treatment of gas in clay- based repository systems were required. This was the primary focus of Task B in DECOVALEX-2023 (D-2023). This paper summarises the outcomes of stages 1 and 2 with work conducted from May 2020 to January 2022 by the four modelling teams participating in the first part of the task:  1. BGR/UFZ (Germany): Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research.  2.

Finally, a discussion of main findings and key conclusions are provided in Sections 5 and 6 respec­tively. It is not the intention of this paper to provide an exhaustive description of the individual contributions from each team, but rather give a technical overview and synthesis of key conclusions and results, highlighting their main differences and similarities (see Appendix A). 2. Experimental data As part of Task B, a new unpublished dataset was required to facil­itate the comparison exercise. In previous stages of DECOVALEX-2019, teams had been given data at the outset with which to develop and calibrate their models. These experiments were based on data derived from tests performed on samples with a nominal length of 120 mm and nominal diameter of 60 mm. However, for the purposes of this numer­ical exercise (test FPR-21–004), the sample geometry was changed from a 2:1 ratio to a 1:1 ratio (sample of 60 mm in length and 60 mm diam­eter). As before, experiments were performed in a constant volume cell with material subject to rehydration first and then gas flow. 2.1. Experimental set-up In this test geometry, the specimen is volumetrically constrained, preventing bulk dilation of the clay in any direction. This BGS custom- designed apparatus, Fig. 1, has six main components: (i) a thick- walled, dual-closure pressure vessel; (ii) an injection pressure system; (iii) a backpressure system; (iv) 24 total stress gauges to measure radial and axial total stresses; (v) two filters for monitoring porewater pres­sure; and (6) a data acquisition system based around a National In­struments Compact Rio set-up. The pressure vessel comprised of a dual-closure tubular vessel manufactured from Invar (a nickel-iron alloy with a low thermal expansion coefficient, also known as Alloy 36) and was pressure-tested to 70 MPa. Each end-closure was secured by eight high tensile cap screws which could be used to apply a small pre-stress to the specimen if required. The vessel was mounted vertically with injection of gas through a rod mounted in the lower end-closure, Fig. 1, the dimensions of which are presented in Fig. 2. The 60 mm internal bore of the pressure vessel was honed and hard- chromed to give a highly polished surface. Two pore pressure filters, labelled F1 and F2, Fig. 1, were mounted in the lower end-closure and used to provide local measurements for pore pressure during the course of the experiment. The total stress sensors were located in a geometric pattern, Table 1, with 4 radial arrays, each comprised of four sensors, spaced evenly along the sample. Each end-closure also contained four axial total stress sensors, mounted in a square configuration, visible in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2[C] and [D]. The central or injection filter was embedded at the end of a 6.4 mm diameter stainless steel tube and was used to inject helium (see Section 2.3) during gas testing. The end of the filter was profiled to match a standard twist drill to minimize voidage around the injection tip. Pressure and flow rate of test fluids were controlled using two ISCO- 260, Series D, syringe pumps, operating from a single digital control unit. Given the potential for gas leakage past the injection pump seal, a constant flow rate was developed by displacing gas from a pre-charged cylinder by injecting water. This also helped to ensure that the helium was saturated with water vapour prior to injection, reducing the po­tential for desiccation. A second pre-charge vessel was placed in the backpressure circuit to collect the gas as it was discharged from the sample. Test data was over-sampled at an acquisition rate of one scan per 20 s. Thereafter, data processing was based on every 10th datapoint, unless something of note occurred within the data. All pressure trans­ducers were calibrated to an accredited laboratory standard and linear least-squares regression fits were applied to the data to ensure its comparability. 2.2. Geotechnical properties Geotechnical properties for the test sample FPR-21–004 were not available at the onset of the modelling exercise, as testing was still ongoing. As such, geotechnical data was provided by a second sample, FPR-20–030, manufactured in exactly the same way as that for FPR- 21–004, with data presented in Table 2. Data are calculated based on a grain density of 2.77 g/cm3. 2.3. Test history Details of each test stage are presented in Table 3. Sample FPR- 21–004 was subject to a series of test stages to promote swelling and resaturation (stages 1 and 2), equilibration (stage 3) gas injection (stage 4) and self-sealing (stage 5). 2.4. Results Following installation of the sample, a small backpressure of 250 kPa was simultaneously applied to the backpressure filter and both F1 and F2 filters, Fig. 1. On day 3.1 (test stage 2), pressure in all three filters was increased to 1.0 MPa, and the sample allowed to hydrate.

At the same time, water pressure was increased and the gas (helium) pressure in the injection filter was also incremented to match the change in water pressure. This was done in order to prevent acci­dental water flow into the filter and thus remove the possibility of slug flow (i.e., gas displacement of water from the filter ahead of gas entry into the sample) during gas injection (stage 4). Examination of the axial stress data, Fig. 3, shows a progressive increase in stress, axially throughout the sample. Unsurprisingly, stresses were systematically higher at the top of the core, adjacent to the large backpressure filter, where access to water was unlimited. At the base of the sample, access to water was limited to that available in the small filters F1 and F2, see average stresses A1-A4 in Fig. 3[B]. By the end of stage 2, this resulted in an average axial stress of 7.5 MPa, compared to 8.5 MPa at the top of the sample.

However, based on the final 5 days of data from this stage, the rates of change were relatively small: 11.3 and 3.4 kPa/d for A1-A4 and A5-A8 respectively. The higher rate of change in the base of the sample relates to the aforementioned availability (or rather lack) of water. It is also noteworthy that, by the end of the stage, the variation in axial stress measured across each plane was very similar (0.69 MPa and 0.63 MPa for A1-A4 and A5-A8 respectively), see Table 4. The development of radial stress evolves in a similar manner to that of the axial stress. When the clay was exposed to water, radial stresses also rapidly increased, Fig. 4, approaching a well-defined asymptote by the end of the stage. Inspection of the data shows some variability, even across the same plane of measurement, such as the difference in values between sensors R9 to R12, or R13 to R16. Analysis of the data in Table 4, indicates larger variations in pressure exist as the distance to the points of measurement increase from the three sources of hydration. This results in some degree of heterogeneity in the resultant stress field at the end of stage 2, probably linked to a combination of incomplete homogenisation of the bentonite and subtle variations in the micro­structure of the sample. The data in Fig. 5 indicates that average radial stress does not change along the length of the sample. This suggests that friction between the sample and vessel wall is likely to play a small (if any) role in the development of the stress on the scale of the experiment. The difference between axial stress at the top and bottom of the sample (Fig. 3) therefore relates to the availability of water (which is less at the base of the sample) suggesting incomplete homogenisation at this region of the sample. However, the length of time required to fully homogenise bentonite is unclear and remains a research priority within the European Community. As time was limited and the average values of radial stress, Fig. 5, were relatively similar across each measurement, the sample was deemed ready for gas testing. Following a brief period of further equilibration, gas testing (stage 4) began on day 28.4, with the injection pump set at a constant displace­ment rate of 180 μl/h. Gas pressure gradually increased for the following 49.4 days, reaching a peak value of 12.36 MPa at day 77.8, see Fig. 6. This was followed by a spontaneous negative pressure transient leading to a quasi-steady state around day 84.9. At this point, the injection pump was stopped, test stage 5, and the pressure allowed to slowly decay. Gas pressure continued to decline until the test was stopped at day 117. Closer inspection of the axial stress data, see Fig. 7[A], suggests a small gas entry (i.e., onset of flow into the clay) event occurred around day 70.1, shortly after gas pressure exceeded the lowest value of axial stress. However, inspection of the outflow data, Fig. 7[B], shows no obvious sign of discharge. In the absence of a suitable sink, gas pressure therefore continued to increase, finally resulting in a major gas entry event around day 74.3 at a gas pressure of around 9.84 MPa. In the intervening time between the precursor and major entry events, the rate of change in all stress traces began to increase, providing clear evidence of a hydrody­namic effect caused by the coupling between gas pressure and axial stress. Further examination of the outflow data following the major gas entry event at day 74.3, Fig. 7[B], suggests a very small increase in outflow occurred around this time, possibly caused by compaction of the clay following major gas entry. However, gas breakthrough did not occur until day 75.5, from which it can be inferred that it took 1.2 days for sufficient pathways to develop and locate the backpressure filter. At this point, outflow rapidly increased and was associated with a series of spontaneous changes in the stress field, Fig. 7[A]. However, the initial development of permeability was short-lived, as conductive pathways began to spontaneously close and outflow quickly decreased. From day 76.1 to 76.5, outflow reduced to pre-major breakthrough levels and was accompanied by further increases in gas pressure and stresses within the sample, as gas pathways developed to reconnect with the backpressure filter. Towards the right margin of Fig. 7[B], outflow from the sample spontaneously increased for a second time at day 76.5 and was again associated with complex changes in the stress field. Fig. 8 shows the evolution of axial stress in response to the devel­opment of flow out of the sample. Gradual and abrupt changes in gas pressure and stress were observed that are interpreted as linking to the development of flow paths within the sample. This behaviour is consistent to previous experimental observations (e.g.,15 and17). Following major gas breakthrough outflow, stress and gas pressure were highly coupled. In general, gas pressure remained slightly above that of axial stress, suggesting some degree of pressure drop along gas path­ways. However, the orientation of the pathways to the direction of stress measurement strongly impacts the measured value of stress. Therefore, a detailed analysis of the stress response (axial and radial) is required and will be undertaken at a future date.

This suggests a degree of time-dependent behaviour in the development of gas pathways and thus permeability within the sample. However, by the end of the test stage at day 84.9, Fig. 8[B], inflow and outflow were converging, signifying the test was approaching a near steady state condition. However, close examination of the data shows small discrepancy between inflow and outflow data at day 84.9. As the system was not in true steady-state, it is not possible to identify the true origin of this discrepancy, but might stem from a small background leak. As soon as the injection pump was stopped, gas pressure, axial stress and outflow from the sample rapidly decreased, Fig. 9. For the first time, gas pressure dropped below axial stresses A2 and A5 through A8, sug­gesting depressurisation of some pathways and trapping of residual gas Fig. 7.

From day 87, a more gradual decline in gas pressure and axial stress was observed. By the end of the stage, gas pressure was over 1.0 MPa lower than axial stress at sensors A5 and A6. Examination of Fig. 9 indicates the variation in total stress increases as the shut-in stage progresses. This is likely caused by the localised closure of gas pathways, resulting in the entrapment of gas within the sample, perturbating the stress field. The disconnect between outflow and changes in axial stress and gas pressure suggests complex patterns of flow drainage, which spatially evolved within the clay. This indicates that pathway closure can be rapid, as in the early stages of the shut-in response, or slow, as illustrated by the subsequent gradual decline in axial stresses and gas pressure. The early, rapid, pathway closure may be driven by the elastic (compress­ibility) of the material and the subsequent gradual response by the slow diffusion and egress of gas trapped along now partially sealed pathways. Fig. 10 shows the evolution of radial stress during gas injection, test stages 4 and 5. These sensors showed qualitatively similar behaviour to that previously discussed for axial stress. Considerable variations in stress values were observed across each plane, Fig. 11, ranging from 140 kPa to 2650 kPa. The data clearly shows the evolutionary and complex nature of the stress field induced during advective gas flow and is likely linked to the localised internal development of gas pathways within the clay. A plot of average stress for each plane of measurement, Fig. 12, shows that once major gas entry occurred, stress increased fairly consistently throughout the sample, with the exception of R13-R16. Here peak stress was substantially lower compared to all other arrays, suggesting fewer pathways propagated towards the top of the sample. In Fig. 10. Radial stress data for FPR-21–004.

The highest stress values occurred in array R1- R4, closest to the backpressure filter, indicating that (i) the gas pressure gradient induced presumably small pathways and (ii) most of the pres­sure drop between the gas phase and the water within the backpressure filter occurred in a narrow zone close, or at, the edge of the sample. The evolution in pore pressure at filters F1 and F2, within sample FPR-21–004, is shown in Figure 13[A]. Following the cessation of hy­dration at day 27.2, a gradual decrease in pressure was observed, illustrating that the sample was not in full hydraulic equilibrium at the onset of gas testing. As hydration continued from the backpressure filter, a gradual increase in water pressure was seen from around day 38 and 49 in filters F1 and F2 respectively. Figure 13[B] shows the development of pore pressure during gas entry and subsequent breakthrough events. As major gas entry occurred at day 74.3, both filters showed an increase in pressure, probably related to a hydrodynamic effect during the displacement and compaction of the clay at gas entry. As injection gas breakthrough occurred at day 75.5, filter F2 showed a rapid increase in pressure, most likely due to the arrival of gas at the filter. Gas pressure peaked at 6.64 MPa and then began to gradually decrease. A second breakthrough event in the same filter, occurred at day 84 when pressure rapidly increased. Filter pressure then appeared correlated to the gas pressure with an offset of around 0.7 MPa by the end of stage 5. This data also demonstrates that the pressure drop along the connected gas pathways, from the injection point to the filter, was relatively small. In contrast, the development of pressure within filter F1 showed no abrupt changes in pressure as with filter F2. This suggests that filter F1 was likely recording local hydrodynamic changes in porewater pressure due to displacement and localised compaction of the clay as gas path­ways formed. However, the increase in pressure of filter F1 from around day 87, as gas pressure declined, might be linked to the slow discharge of gas into the filter as the pathways began to drain. 3. Enriched multi-phase modelling approaches Three different numerical approaches have been adopted by BGR/ UFZ, LBNL and CIMNE-UPC/Andra (see also Appendix A for details about their key similarities and differences). These three strategies are based on the general theory of multi-phase flow modelling and are combined with additional features to describe some of the key aspects observed in gas-laboratory tests that distinguish clay-rich media from other rock-types (e.g., deformation of the porous media, creation of dilatant preferential pathways that open and eventually self-seal). Indeed, the bentonite sample is modelled as a deformable porous me­dium that behaves as either an elastic (LBNL, CIMNE-UPC/Andra) or an elasto-plastic (BGR/UFZ) solid. Intrinsic permeability is treated as a function of other properties during the gas injection test, representing the dilatant pathways. In particular, intrinsic permeability is assumed to depend either on the strain tensor (BGR/UFZ), on the effective minimum compressive stress (LBNL) or on the embedded fractures aperture and spacing (CIMNE-UPC/Andra). The water retention curve is also assumed to be a function of embedded fractures aperture and spacing in the model developed by CIMNE-UPC/Andra. 3.1. Model developed by BGR/UFZ 3.1.1. Conceptual model The model expands upon the work performed by BGR/UFZ within the Task A DECOVALEX-2019 (D-2019), where the team developed a hydro-mechanical model for migration of gas through a low-permeable linear elastic geomaterial that included a pressure-dependent intrinsic permeability. Indeed, for the current phase of DECOVALEX-2023, BGR/ UFZ developed a fully coupled, hydro-mechanical model based on multi- phase flow theory,23 whose key features are:  • Constitutive relations for the hydraulic behaviour: the Mualem model is adopted for the description of the relative permeabilities of gas and water whereas the relationship between water saturation and capillary pressure is based on the van Genuchten formulation,34.  • Constitutive relations for the mechanical behaviour: bentonite is assumed to behave as an elasto-plastic porous medium. Hooke’s law is assumed to describe the stress-strain relationship in the elastic regime of the material whereas the Drucker-Prager failure criterion is assumed to describe the plastic deformation (perfect plasticity with non-associated flow). This is enhanced with a tension cut-off parameter to limit the load carrying capacity of the model near the tensile region.  • Hydro-mechanical coupling: Biot’s theory35 is assumed to describe the hydro-mechanical coupling. That is, the effective stress tensor σ′ (Pa) is calculated from the pore pressure p and the total stress tensor σ as σ′ = σ −αp(1) (where α (-) is the Biot’s coefficient) and used to define the linear momentum balance equation of the porous medium ∇[σ′ −α(pg −Swpc)I]+ ρg = 0(2)  where pg (Pa) is the gas pressure, Sw (-) is the water saturation, pc (Pa) is the capillary pressure, I is the identity tensor, ρ (kg/m3) is the total density and g (m/s2) is the gravitational acceleration. Material heterogeneity is included in the model by means of the gas entry pressure and Young’s modulus, which are described with a het­erogeneous distribution. Both can be derived from a non-uniform dis­tribution of the dry density, which has been observed in similar experiments.36 The approach does not attempt to represent the scale of Fig. 13.

Numerical models based on conventional multi-phase flow theory have historically been applied to predict the outcome and impact of gas flow on different repository components. However, they remain unable to describe the full complexity of the physical processes observed in water-saturated experiments (e.g., creation of dilatant pathways) and thus, the development of novel representations for their description is required when assessing fully saturated clay-based systems. This was the primary focus of Task A within the international cooperative project DECOVALEX-2019 (D-2019) and refinement of these approaches is the primary focus of this study (Task B in the current phase of DECOVALEX-2023). This paper summarises development of enhanced numerical representations of key processes and compares the performance of each model against high-quality laboratory test data. Experimental data reveals that gas percolation in water-saturated compacted bentonite is characterised by four key features: (i) a quiescence phase, followed by (ii) the gas breakthrough, which leads to a (iii) peak value, which is then followed by (iv) a negative decay. Three models based on the multiphase flow theory have been developed. These models can provide good initial values and reasonable responses for gas breakthrough (although some of them still predict a too-smooth response). Peak gas pressure values are in general reasonably well captured, although maximum radial stress differences are observed at 48 mm from the base of the sample. Here, numerical peak values of 12.8 MPa are predicted, whereas experimental values are about 11 MPa. These models are also capable of providing a reasonable representation of the negative pressure decay following peak pressure. However, other key specific features (such as the timing of gas breakthrough) still require a better representation. The model simulations and their comparison with experimental data show that these models need to be further improved with respect to model parameter calibration, the numerical representation of spatial heterogeneities in material properties and flow localisation, and the upscaling of the related physical processes and parameters. To further understand gas flow localisation, a new conceptual model has been developed, which shows that discrete channels can possibly be induced through the instability of gas-bentonite interface during gas injection, thus providing a new perspective for modeling gas percolation in low-permeability deformable media.   1. Introduction In all repository concepts for the geological disposal of radioactive waste, an engineered barrier system (EBS) is used to encapsulate the waste canister, or, to act as borehole or gallery seals.1 These systems are often based on bentonite clays due to their low permeability1–4 and high swelling capacity enabling the closure of engineering voids.5–7 However, in all repository concepts gases will be generated through the corrosion * Corresponding author.

Based on the results discussed in Section 3.2, parameters of different constitutive models at the compaction stage and post-compaction stage are obtained using corresponding equations, which are displayed in Figs. 6–9.

Although these total constitutive models based on various combinations of compaction and post-compaction models deriving from different sta­tistical strength distribution of rock units both demonstrate good fitting performance, there are still differences in values of R2 and RMSE among Fig. 11.

Therefore, it is necessary to select suitable constitutive models for different type of rocks in these sixteen models based on the values of R2 and RMSE. After comparison among these sixteen models, model XVI, model XV, model IX, and model XIV are more suitable for describing the deformation characteristics of the sample BU2, the sample BU5, the sample BU9, and the sample BU12, respectively. Meanwhile, as shown in Figs. 6–9, the measured stress of most rock samples rapidly decreases and approaches to the very small value after peak point, indicating the instantaneous loss of the bearing capacity. Therefore, this study mainly focuses on the deformation characteristics of rock samples before peak point. To characterize the obvious brittleness observed during the experimental process, the brittleness index is subsequently established based on the total damage evolution equation of proposed constitutive models before failure. 5.2. Brittleness evaluation of rock based on constitutive model of damage 5.2.1. Brittleness index based on energy method We explore the potential influence of the damage variable on the brittleness index by investigating the changes in energy during the compression process. Our objective is to understand the relationship between the stored elastic energy and the energy consumed in the process of failure. As mentioned in Section 1, here the energy method is utilized to measure the brittleness index. And as discussed in Section 3.3, the pre-peak stage is chosen as our study object. U is the total absorbed strain energy during compression; Ue is releasable elastic strain energy under compression; Ud is the strain energy normally consumed for plastic deformation or crack propagation (as shown in Fig. 10). Ud = U −Ue(40) Ud indicates the energy that has been consumed during compression. The brittleness of the rock increases with a decrease in Ud as it results in higher energy storage during failure and a greater extent of rock failure. Fig. 12.

For instance, when subjected to compressive tests, brittle rock exhibits a pronounced loss of stability, accompanied by the forceful fragmentation and scattering of rock blocks. These characteristics are clear indicators of significant brittleness, resembling the properties associated with an ideal brittle state.

From Eq. (44), the relationship between brittleness indicators and rock damage variables can be expressed as: B43 = εvar(1 −Di) + Cvarηi(45)  Where εvar =1 −εcεi,Cvar =(1 −EimEtm)Ccεcεi and ηi =(σi−σc)(0.5(εi−εc)+ln(εi−εc) )+σc(εi−εc)+12 (Etm−Eim)ε2i Cc+12Eimε2i0.5∗εi∗σi; Cc is the compaction coefficient at the compaction point. Based on Eq. (45), the brittleness index B43 can be deduced as: B43 = εcon(1 −Dpeak)+ Cconη(46)  Where εcon =1 −εcεp,Ccon =(1 −EimEtm)Ccεcεp and η =(σp−σc)(0.5(εp−εc)+ln(εp−εc))+σc(εp−εc)+12 (Etm−Eim)ε2pCc+12Eimε2p0.5∗εp∗σp; Dpeak is the damage variable when the dependent variable is εp. Eq. (45) shows that B43 varies within a range from 0 to 1, and the closer B43 is to 1, the more obvious the brittleness of rock samples is. Meanwhile, natural rocks masses are the complex heterogeneous geological material containing different type of micro-cracks, and the interactions of these weak structures during the whole loading process will involve a part of energy consumption. Therefore, the initiation and propagation of micro-cracks in rocks not only explains the reason for the generation of a part of dissipative energy, but also shows that damage evolution is a monotonically increasing trend during the whole uniaxial loading process. As micro-cracks continue to propagate, damage extent will increase, which positively influences the energy consumption and brittleness index. This also demonstrates close association between damage extent and brittleness index. In addition, the ductility is closely related to the post peak curve, and stress-strain curves in which the post peak strength decreases to a very small value close to 0 immediately after the peak point may often be related to weak ductility.3 This in­dicates that the proposed method may be more suitable for evaluating Fig. 14.

Meanwhile, combined with the constitutive equations from model XV, XVI, IX and XIV with Eq. (41) and Eq. (42), the corresponding ratio (BF) of elastic energy to strain energy from entire compaction point to peak point is showed in Figs. 11(b)-14(a). There is an obvious turning point (YI) to distinguish changes in growth trends of the BF- damage variable curve, which denotes that the BF increases first and then de­creases as the damage variable increases at the pre-peak stage. Mean­while, the axial stress difference (ASD) method is also used to study the mechanical meaning of the inflection point (YI) on stress-strain curves. Figs. 11(b)-14(b) show the position of the value of the damage variable at the inflection point (YI) on the strain-damage curve and the strain- axial stress difference curve. It is clear that the axial stress difference keeps constant before and after the point D and entire compaction point A, but it gradually increases before and after peak point B and the point D, which determines that the point D is the yielding point. Therefore, the BF at the inflection point (YI) is actually the ratio of the elastic energy to the strain energy at the yielding point on the stress-strain curve. This also explains that the increase of dissipative energy leads the decrease of BF after the yielding point. In addition, it is also observed from Figs. 11 (b)-14(b) that before point Y, the damage variable is in a slow growth stage and the stress difference remains roughly unchanged, corre­sponding to the stable propagation of cracks. Then, after point Y, the damage variable enters an accelerated growth stage and the stress difference increases, indicating the unstable propagation of cracks, and accompanied by the appearance of macroscopic cracks on rock samples. 5.2.2. Brittleness index of rock based on damage characteristics To further investigate the influence of the damage variable of peak strain on the brittleness index, it is assumed that the damage variable of peak strain varies from 0 to 1. Based on the constitutive equations from model XV, XVI, IX and XIV, and Eq. (46), the relation between the brittleness index and the damage variable of peak strain follows the nonlinear pattern, as shown displayed in Fig. 15. The brittleness index of rock decreases with increasing the damage variable of peak strain for different types of rocks. This indicates that the greater the extent of damage of peak strain, the more energy consumed, and the less obvious the brittleness. 5.3. Discussion To further illustrate the performance of these sixteen constitutive models on determining the brittleness index, the data of different type of rocks is selected from other literature (as display in Table 5). The constitutive models and brittleness index corresponding to different type of rocks are displayed in Table 5.

The results demonstrate that orthoclase, plagioclase and quartz exert positive influence on the UCS, while amphibole exhibits weak correlation with UCS. Meanwhile, four major mineral components also show a correlation with the brittleness index and BF. Orthoclase and quartz have positive effects on the brittleness, which suggests that the presence of Orthoclase and quartz increases the brittleness of rocks. But negative correlation between plagioclase and the brittleness index indicates that the presence of plagioclase increases its ductile. And amphibole shows weak correlation with the brittleness index and BF. Then, Fig. 17 shows that there is no clear quantitative relationship or indicator to quantify the changes trend of the brittleness index and BF with varying UCS. Finally, as shown in Fig. 18, a syn­chronous correlation between brittleness index and BF is evident, dis­playing a gradual increase in brittleness index as BF rises, with a rough linear relationship. In addition, the brittleness index determined by different evaluation methods for different tests in the same rock sample is displayed in Table 6. The brittleness index based on different evaluation methods ranges from 0 to 1. To compare different evaluation methods of the brittleness index, standard deviations80 are introduced to evaluate the magnitude of the divergence of the estimation results of the same type of the rock, as displayed in Table 7. Meanwhile, Fig. 19 also shows that the brittleness index calculated by this proposed evaluation method are much more consistent for different tests with one rock type because of its lower magnitude of the divergence. This may be because the brittleness index obtained by the proposed method derives from the stress-strain curve, while the previous brittleness index mainly is obtained based on some certain points of the stress-strain curve, such as the peak points and residual points. However, the research in this paper still has limitations in the following aspects, including: (1) as the natural damage material, it is difficult to accurately determine the initial damage of rocks and present the influence of the initial damage on the brittleness with certain tech­nical means; (2) This research on the relationship between brittleness and damage still remains at the theoretical level, and corresponding experimental verification needs to be further conducted; (3) This study cannot clearly demonstrated the relationship between the brittleness and evolution patterns, and further research needs to conducted; (4) For a certain type of stress-strain curves in which there is inapparent post- peak region and the stress suddenly decreases to a small value close to 0 in a short time after peak point (as shown in Fig. 20), although the deformation characteristics in the post peak stage are similar, the Fig. 17.

These sixteen proposed models in this paper have good flexibility and adapt­ability to correspond to these diverse deformation situations compared with the single model. But under the traditional triaxial and true triaxial stress state, when the deformation characteristics are similar to those shown in Fig. 21, the corresponding class I and class II curves have obvious post-peak stage. This proposed evaluate method that neglects to consider the post-peak strength is not accurate to estimate the brittleness index and needs further improvement. 6. Conclusions In this study, considering deformation features of rocks under the uniaxial loading condition, sixteen piecewise constitutive models are proposed based on various combinations of different distribution func­tions for suitable rocks. A new brittleness index (B43) to determine rock brittleness is proposed based on an energy method by considering rock damage. And the validity and advantages of the proposed evaluation method have been demonstrated by conducting the comparison between the new brittleness index and previous indexes. Especially in practical drilling or fracturing engineering, rocks are often accompanied by continuous damage, which will influence the brittleness. This proposed evaluation method can provide theoretical guidance on the relation between the brittleness and rock damage. The main conclusions of this study are summarized as follows:  (1) The internal deflects of rock can be described using the statistical distribution patterns of meso damage. The values of R2 among these sixteen models for different type of rock samples are greater than 0.79, which indicates that constitutive models based on different combination based on power function distribution, Weibull distribution, lognormal distribution and logistic function distribution for describing the stress strain relations before the peak for different types of rock. And comparison results in terms of R2 and RMSE can provide the basis to select suitable models among these sixteen constitutive models when studying different type of rocks.  (2) The brittleness index of different types of rocks decreases with the increase of the damage variable of peak strain.  (3) The increase of orthoclase and quartz contents in the rock leads the increase of the brittleness, while the presence of plagioclase increases its ductile.  (4) The new brittleness index demonstrates improved capability in generating stable and consistent results across diverse tests for specific rock types.

The indexes B38 and B39 lack specific quantitative methods to evaluate the corresponding area or energy. The indexes B36 and B42ignore the specific physical meaning. Therefore, developing one universal and applicable brittleness index in rock me­chanics is still a challenging issue. The rock is a collection of various minerals in nature, containing many microcracks and micropores, and is a veritable natural damage material.5,53,64 Under the loading conditions, it will undergo deforma­tion and damage evolution, which will be accompanied by the energy conversion, including energy accumulation, dissipation and release.8,18, 69,71,79,92 The accumulation will lead micro-cracks or pores to propa­gating and extending, which eventually results in the unstable failure of rocks. For the ductile rocks, the long-term transformation process from energy accumulation to dissipation will lead to progressive damage of ductile rocks,73,80 but brittle rocks often experience sudden damage at a certain level of compression, which is accompanied by a sudden release of energy with a short time.80,85 This shows the close relation between brittleness, rock damage and energy. Meanwhile, the energy of the rock deformation and damage evolution can be characterized using the stress-strain curve.9,38,94 A range of constitutive models considering the damage evolution has been established to study the damage evolution law of each deformation stage and the mechanical properties.24,28,39,52, 90,93 They established different damage constitutive models based on different damage variables to model damage evolution and energy conversion characteristics at different loading stages for deriving alter­native methods to evaluate the brittleness of rocks. Therefore, the development of rock damage constitutive model provides us with an alternative method for exterminating the brittleness of rocks. Above all, previous methods have made significant contributions to the brittleness assessment, but each has its own limitations. And different types of rock have various damage evolution laws, deformation behaviours and energy conversion characteristics mechanical behavior and energy conversion characteristics. Therefore, considering the feasibility of damage constitutive relation in analyzing brittleness, it is necessary to analyze the damage evolution process and evaluate the mechanical behavior of rocks from a new perspective. A new brittleness index B43 is introduced by using piecewise constitutive models including the compaction stage and non-compaction stage based on different micro-element strength distribution, such as Weibull distribution,17,88 lognormal or normal distribution,11,40,48 logistic distribution55,82,87 and power function distribution.10,48 Then laboratory tests are conducted to validate its reliability with different rock samples and exhibit its ad­vantages in modeling the diversity of deformation characteristics of different types of rocks before peak point. Lastly, the correlation be­tween brittleness index B43 and damage variable is studied. In addition, the correlation between mineral compositions of rocks, uniaxial compression strength and the brittleness is also studied. This study presents a new devised index for assessing rock brittleness, which takes into account the piecewise statistical damage model and the dynamic damage evolution during loading. This would be useful in future engi­neering practices especially for hydraulic fracturing and drilling. 2. Experimental materials and procedures 2.1. Rock specimen preparation The SANS testing machine is used in this experimental work. This experimental machine can perform compression, tensile and shear tests. The maximum loading pressure and displacement estimation precision of the testing machine were 300KN and ± 0.5%, respectively. According to rock mechanics experimental test standard (DZ/T 0276.18–2015), the rock with uniaxial compressive test is processed the rock sample with a height-diameter ratio of 2:1. This experimental work uses rock sample processing equipment to process the rock into cylindrical specimens with a size of 130 mm × 65 mm, and the error range of machining di­mensions does not exceed 5% . The rock samples are collected from a coal mine located in Henan province, China. The representative samples are prepared from the same rock block to keep the chemical and mineralogical composition uniform. The cylindrical shaped samples are prepared for the experimental work having dimensions of 130 mm × 65 mm. The rock samples are polished with sandpaper to keep the parallelism of the end face within ± 0.2 mm. A total 12 rock samples are prepared for experimental work. 2.2. Uniaxial compression tests SANS testing machine is used to conduct uniaxial compression tests, as shown in Fig. 2. The axial and circumferential extensometers are used to measure the axial and lateral strains. The displacement-control loading mode is used at a loading rate of 0.1 mm/min. The measured mechanical properties of samples are listed in Table 2. 2.3.

Therefore, as shown in Fig. 3, at the compaction stage, micro- voids and micro-cracks inside the rock gradually close, and the com­pacted rock then has linear response to external load and the tangent deformation modulus remains approximately unchanged at the linear elasticity stage, in which minor mechanical damage within the specimen also occurs during this stage based on the concept of statistical damage model. Next, yielding arises accompanied by the formation of the major mechanical damage inside the specimen and the decrease of tangent deformation modulus. Finally, major mechanical damages inside the specimen coalesce and propagate to cause more pronounced macro­scopic failures, resulting in rapid decrease in the bearing capacity of rock samples. In addition, although most of rock samples exhibit different deformation patterns, they have a similar characteristic that the strength of samples rapidly decreases a very small value close to 0 after the peak point, which reflects obvious brittleness. The stress-strain curves show more significant nonlinear deformation during the compaction stage based on quantitative analysis. To develop a more appropriate constitutive model that can accurately depict the aforementioned characteristics, the stress-strain curve is partitioned into two primary sections, with the endpoint of the compaction stage acting as the dividing point, as illustrated in Fig. 4. This point is referred to as the entire compaction point in this paper. A piecewise constitutive model is then established accordingly. For the curve shown in Fig. 4, the correct determination of the entire compaction point becomes essential. Existing methods to determine the Fig. 2. Uniaxial compression test.  K.

Therefore, in this study, a new method is proposed based on the axial stress difference to identify this entire compaction point. Before determining the entire compaction point between compaction stage and linearly elastic stage, a method to judge the linearly elastic stage in the stress-strain curve was selected based on the slope Ki be­tween an arbitrary test data point P(εi, σi) and an initial point P0(εP0, σP0)that is equal to 30–40% of peak stress σp because it was within the lin­early elastic stage at this range (Wang et al.,2019; Xie et al., 2022). The slope Ki can be expressed by the Eq. (1), indicating that it gradually increases at the compaction stage and reaches the maximum value at the beginning point of the linearly elastic stage. Ki = σP0 −σiεP0 −εi(1) Then, a novel method of determining an entire compaction point is proposed, as shown in Fig. 5. The exact operation process includes: (1) determining the tangent deformation modulus ETM using Eq. (1), as shown in Fig. 5(a); (2) constructing the axial stress difference-strain curves, as shown in Fig. 5(b); (3) determining the demarcation point on the axial stress difference-strain curves. The detailed values are listed in Table 3. 3. The compaction coefficient and damage variable under the uniaxial loading conditions 3.1. Compaction coefficient at the compaction stage Notably, the stress–strain curve of rock is a nonlinear concave curve in the initial compaction stage. In this stage, the deformation modulus of rock gradually increases with the axial strain due to the closure of the primary micro-defects. To describe the increasing law of deformation modulus from initial deformation modulus to maximum deformation modulus (tangent modulus), it is assumed that the compaction process characterized by a compaction coefficient C,19,27 which increases with compaction, as shown below: E0 = Eim + (Etm −Eim)C(2)  Where Eim is the initial deformation modulus, E0 is the deformation modulus and Etm is the tangent deformation modulus. The relation between the axial strain, elastic strain and plastic strain can be expressed as: ε = εp + εe(3)  Where εp is the plastic strain, and εe is the elastic strain. Based on the Eq. (1), the relation between deformation modulus and the axial strain can be expressed as: Table 2 Uniaxial compression test results.

(2), Eq. (4) can be rewritten as: σ = (Eim + (Etm −Eim)C)ε(5)  Where σ is the stress. 3.2. The damage variable at the post-compaction stage Based on the damage mechanics and rock mechanics, the damage mechanism in the post-compaction stage will be different. Instead of related to the compaction of defect voids, the mechanism in this stage is related to internal damages such as crack initiations and propagations due to the increase in external load. The damage variable is used to characterize the extent of internal damage of rocks at the post- compaction stage,70 the corresponding constitutive relation70 of rocks at the post-compaction stage under uniaxial loading conditions can be expressed as: σ = Etmε(1 −Dp)(6)  Where Dp is the damage variable at the post-compaction stage, ε is the strain under the axial loading condition, and σ is the stress under the axial loading condition. To ensure the continuity of the constitutive equation, Eq. (6) can be rewritten as: σ = Etm(ε −εc)(1 −Dp)+ σc(7)  Where εc is the strain at the entire compaction point, σc is the stress at the entire compaction point. Based on Eq. (7), the damage variable Dp can be expressed as: Dp = 1 −σ −σcEtm(ε −εc)(8)  3.3. The compaction coefficient and damage evolution equation Based Eq. (5) and Eq.

The constitutive model on statistical damage of rocks under the uniaxial loading conditions The damage evolution equation is established using the assumption of random distribution of micro-units’ strength. And the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion is used here because of its simplicity and practicality.82 Therefore, power function distribution, lognormal distribution, Weibull distribution and logistic distribution are adopted here to study corre­sponding constitutive model of damage. The stress level F can be represented by the common M-C criterion as: F = σ∗1 −σ∗3 −(σ∗1 + σ∗3)sinφ = ccosφ(10)  where σ∗1, σ∗2and σ∗3 denote the effective principal stresses and σ∗1 ≥σ∗2 ≥σ∗3 and c and φ denote the cohesion and internal friction angle of the material, respectively. Based on the uniaxial compression condition and equivalent strain hypothesis,13,56,70 the effective principal stress follows the Hooke’s law, and Eq. (10) can be rewritten as: F = Eε(1 −sinφ)(11)  Where E is the elastic modulus, ε is the axial strain and φ is the internal friction angle. At certain stress level F, the number of fully compacted defects is nε. If the total number of defects is n, then the compaction coefficient C with dimensionless analysis can be expressed as: C = nεn =∫F0p(F/Etm)dF(12)  where p(x) is the probability density function of the micro units strength of rocks. Similarity, at the post-compaction stage, the total number of micro units is N; n units out of N fail under a certain loading.

The definition and evaluation method of the rock brittleness has not yet been unified and stan­dardized due to their diversity. We therefore develop an evaluation method of the rock brittleness based on statistical damage relation. A set of uniaxial compression tests on different rock samples are conducted, and corresponding experimental data is collected and analyzed. Then we establish piecewise damage constitutive models based on different combinations of statistical distribution functions, including power function distribu­tion, Weibull distribution, lognormal distribution and logistic distribution. A new evaluation method of rock brittleness based on energy method and the piecewise statistical damage constitutive model is proposed, and the evaluation results show that the increase of damage variable of peak strain will undermine rock brittleness, and the mineral composition contents have influence on the brittleness of rocks. Comparison work between this proposed method and previous brittleness criteria shows that the brittleness index B43 exhibits enhanced stability and consistency in rock brittleness. This study presents a novel method to studying rock brittleness, enhancing current evaluation methods and deepening our understanding of the rock index. Regarding practical application, some field operations involved with the process of drilling or fracturing lead the continuous damage evolution of rocks under loading conditions. The brittleness index from the proposed evaluation method is comparatively reliable and practical for on-site drilling and fracturing.   1. Introduction Brittleness is a very considerable mechanical property of intact rocks because it causes strong impacts on the rock fracturing process and failure behaviours. Accurate evaluations of the rock brittleness are of great importance in engineering geology and geotechnical engineering, including hydraulic fracturing and drilling,8,29,33,56,82,86 geothermal reservoir exploitation,80 mining or tunnelling activities,75 etc. There is not yet any precise definition on the concept of rock brittleness, and there is no consensus among existing brittleness criterions on which one is more reliable (4,31,39,41,54; Altindag,2003;3,72; Munoz et al.,59,43). Up to now, many studies have been devoted to analyzing rock brittleness and rock failure by means of laboratory tests such as penetration test, indentation test, point load test, pulling test, uniaxial or triaxial compression test or micro-scratch test,68,81,84 theoretical analyses,3,52,76 and numerical modeling based on FEM or FDM.10,23,61 Many different brittleness indexes can be roughly categorized into seven groups based on the parameters or different measurement methods, as displayed in Table 1. These rock brittleness indexes are extremely important for analyzing the process of rock failure in mining, tunneling, dam, foun­dation and drilling operations.89,48 Particularly, the rock brittleness index based on energy method is the most popular among the existing index37,47,48,57 and can better reflect properties of the rock under loading. However, some existing index also have their own shortcom­ings. The index (B33to B35) are only applied in single filed rather than multi-field because they are developed and applied in a specific region based on one particular measurement method. The index (B1to B7 and B27to B29) based on strength method lack explicit physical meanings and direct links with the rock fracture process. The index (B8, B9 to B12, B13 to B20, B21 to B24, B37, B40 and B41) ignores the complete deformation stage, either only considering the pre peak stage or only considering the post peak stage, especially the quantification method of additional en­ergy or surface energy is still controversial. The indexes B25to B26 cannot effectively differentiate the brittleness for different types of rocks. The indexes B30 and B31 are only applied in a specific condition rather than any conditions. The index B32 only considers single fracture models * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: k.chen@tum.de (K. Chen), roberto.cudmani@tum.de (R. Cudmani), andres.pena@tum.de (A. Pe˜na).

The measured horizontal andvertical borehole diameters and their ratio are used as qualitativeinstead of quantitative constraints.At each of the calibration and constraint procedures, we selecteda pair of appropriate horizontal strain correction factors 𝜖ℎand 𝜖𝐻tofit the poro-elastic horizontal stresses Eqs. (1) and (2). These horizon-tal strain correction factors are summarized in Table 2. In all cases,the minimum horizontal stress is fixed and calibrated by the closurepressure estimations from DFITs, and at the same time, the maximumhorizontal stress satisfies the constraints. Fig. 8 shows the estimated fullin-situ stress profiles after the calibration and individual constraints.In each track, the cyan line is the formation pore pressure; the greencurve is the minimum horizontal stress; the blue curve is the maximumhorizontal stress; and the black line is the vertical stress. Red dotsare pore pressure data from DFITs, black dots are estimated closurepressures from DFITs.Note that the maximum horizontal stress magnitude (blue curves ineach track of Fig. 8(a)- (e)) stands for either a lower or upper bound.The variation of the average maximum horizontal stress gradient rangein the Montney Formation, which is bounded by these constraints, isillustrated in Fig. 9.In the following subsections, we will explain in detail these calibra-tion and constraint processes, the final selection of the horizontal straincorrection factors, and the estimation of in-situ stresses for other wellsin the area.4.1. Initial estimation of the maximum horizontal stress range with stresspolygonBefore we start to utilize stress measurements, observation of well-bore failure, as well as borehole caliper logging data to calibrate and/orconstrain the magnitudes of the in-situ stresses, it is often convenient tosimply estimate in-situ stress range using a stress polygon.29 Supposeat a depth of 2130 (TVD) m in well C, we do not have any in-situ stressinformation (such as DFIT), except the pore pressure (12.2 kPa/m) andvertical stress (25.3 kPa/m), the range of allowable horizontal stressfor normal, strike–slip, and reverse faulting regimes are illustrated inFig. 10 using Eq. (4).Mohr–Coulomb circles 1 and 3 on the right side of Fig. 10 representthe critical stress states under reverse and normal faulting regimesrespectively. In the top bar of Fig. 9, since there is no minimumhorizontal stress (𝜎ℎ) information, the total range for the maximumhorizontal stress (𝜎𝐻) is large. The observed upper and lower boundsof the horizontal stresses are 53.5 kPa/m and 16.5 kPa/m respectively.There is no immediate information on the exact stress regime, exceptthat the maximum horizontal stress (𝜎𝐻) is smaller or larger than thevertical stress (𝜎𝑣). Therefore, further calibration and constraints areneeded.4.2. Calibration with stress measurementsIn the process of in-situ stress estimation, calibration, and con-straints, the in-situ stress profile was calculated using the poro-elasticmodel as described by Eqs. (1) and (2). In this calculation, we assumeequal horizontal strain correction values (𝜖ℎ= 𝜖𝐻= 0.07 mm/m) forboth the maximum and the minimum horizontal stress directions andmanaged the values so that the horizontal in-situ stress profiles werecalibrated with in-situ stress measurement data from DFITs of the fourswells (Well B-E) on the same pad with well A. The results are shownin Fig. 8(a). The purpose of this first step is to calibrate the minimumhorizontal stress profile and keep it fixed from this point on, which isa lower bound of the maximum horizontal stress because this is themagnitude of the smallest principal stress (𝜎𝐻= 𝜎ℎ= 𝜎3).Adjustments on the pair of horizontal strain correction factors 𝜖ℎand 𝜖𝐻will be made when applying constraints in the following sec-tions to make sure that the minimum horizontal stress is still fixed andthe poro-elastic horizontal stresses Eqs. (1) and (2) are fitted.4.3. Constraint: Critical stress stateThe critical stress state model can be further applied to constrain thebound of the maximum horizontal stress magnitude if we also know theminimum horizontal stress magnitude in addition to the vertical one. Toillustrate the procedure, we chose the fixed minimum horizontal stressand vertical stress magnitudes from well C at a TVD depth of 2130 m,assumed a friction coefficient 𝜇of 0.6, and estimated the upper boundof the maximum horizontal stress using the Mohr–Coulomb circles (The```"

Han and M. van der Baansecond Mohr–Coulomb circle in Fig. 10), where 𝜎𝐻is computed usingEq. (4). At the critical state, the observed upper bound of the effectivemaximum horizontal stress is 32.4 MPa, corresponding to a maximumhorizontal stress of 58.4 MPa, and the gradient is27.4 kPa/m. Anyhigher maximum horizontal stress magnitude will cause an overcriticalstress state, leading to a failure of optimally oriented fractures andfaults.Note that the upper bound of the average maximum horizontalstress in the Montney Formation (the red bar on the right end of theblue bar, Fig. 9, a) is 27.4 kPa/m. This upper bound of the maximumhorizontal stress magnitude is larger than the vertical stress (black dashline in Fig. 9). This is also visible in Fig. 8 b at a depth above 2130 m.In the lower section (below 2130 meters in depth), the upper boundof the maximum horizontal stress magnitude is equal to or smallerthan the vertical stress (Fig. 8 b). Therefore, based on the critical stressassumption, the in-situ stress regime of the Montney Formation in thewell A area might vary from a strike–slip fault stress regime in theupper section to a normal fault stress regime in the lower section.Considering these magnitudes are ‘‘upper bounds’’ of the maximumhorizontal stress and the absence of induced seismicity near this well(Fig. 3), a normal instead of strike–slip stress regime is statistically morelikely. Additional in-situ stress information is needed (if available) tofurther constrain the maximum horizontal stress magnitudes.Next, we will further constrain the ranges of the maximum horizon-tal stress magnitudes by checking for the (non)occurrences of boreholebreakouts and/or drilling-induced fractures from the observing imagelog of well A.4.4. Constraint: Breakouts and/or drilling-induced fracturesObservation of the image log of well A indicated that occurrences ofdrilling-induced fractures or breakouts in the Montney Formation wererare. Breakouts and drilling-induced fractures were observed in theBelloy Formation (below the Montney Formation) as shown in Fig. 6. Inorder to demonstrate the theoretical occurrences of induced fracturesor breakouts, based on the Mohr–Coulomb failure criteria, we usedEqs. (5) and (6) to calculate the difference between the left and theright. If the values are close to zero and become positive, then theyindicate that the induced fractures or breakouts occur theoretically.The calculated threshold conditions of breakouts or drilling-inducedfractures for the Montey Formation (Fig. 11, right), and for the BelloyFormation (Fig. 11, left). The predicted failure envelope is at zero; onlypositive values indicate occurrences of breakouts (red curves) and/orinduced fractures (blue curves).Because the maximum horizontal stress is the only unknown pa-rameter in Eqs. (5) and (6), we inverted the upper bound of themaximum horizontal stress magnitude from Eqs. (5) and (6) underthe above-mentioned threshold conditions of breakouts or drilling-induced fractures occurrences for the Montney Formation. Similarly,we inverted the lower bound of the maximum horizontal stress mag-nitude from Eqs. (5) and (6) under the above conditions of breakoutsoccurrences for the Belloy Formation.The resulting upper bound of the maximum horizontal stress mag-nitude gradient of the Montney Formation is 28.1 kPa/m (Fig. 8 c),and the lower bound is 19.9 kPa/m (Fig. 8 d), which are also shown inFig. 9(b). Note again that the upper bound of the maximum horizontalstress magnitude is larger than the vertical stress, implying that thein-situ stress is either a normal or strike–slip faulting regime.4.5. Constraint: Borehole shape measurementsTheoretically, borehole vertical diameter 𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟and horizontal diam-eter 𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟can be calculated using Eqs. (7) and (8) for horizontal wellsdrilled parallel to the minimum horizontal stress directions, which isthe case of horizontal wells C and D on the same pad of well A. Sincethe rock mechanical properties, minimum horizontal stress, verticalstress, formation pore pressure, and drilling mud pressure informationare available, taking well C as an example, we calculated boreholevertical diameter 𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟and horizontal diameter 𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟using Eqs. (7) and(8) for maximum horizontal stress gradients between 17.2 kPa/m and30 kPa/m, based on the range determined in Fig. 9. The ratios of 𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟and ∕𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟are plotted as orange dots in Fig. 12.It is observed from Fig. 12 that the measured borehole diameterratio (𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟/𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟) of 0.98104 exceeds the range of theoretical predictionsin Fig. 12 for isotropic, static rock properties for this formation (Fig. 4).However, the observed diameter ratio points to a normal stress regime.The reason for differences between the measured borehole diameterratio and the theoretically calculated ratio might be due to the variousdrilling operations such as trimming the borehole, trips up and downfor logging tools, as well as the creep effects53,55 that are not coveredin this paper.Therefore, we further constrained the maximum horizontal stressmagnitude with a normal faulting stress regime. We selected horizontalstrain correction factors 𝜖ℎ= 0 mm/m and 𝜖𝐻= 0.38 mm/m, makingsure that the maximum horizontal stress magnitude profile within theMontney Formation is not larger than the vertical stress as shown inFig. 8(e); at the same time, we kept the minimum horizontal stressstill fixed and the poro-elastic horizontal stresses Eqs. (1) and (2) werefitted. After this constraint, the upper bound maximum horizontal stressgradient is 24.2 kPa/m on average of the Montney Formation, whichis also illustrated in Fig. 9(e).The observation of this local existence of a normal fault in-situstress regime in the well A area disagrees with the reported strike–slip or reverse fault stress regime in the Western Canada Sedimen-tary Basin (WCSB).65,73 However, although the direction of the max-imum horizontal stress is well constrained in the WCSB by boreholebreakouts,65,73 the faulting regime as shown in Fig. 2 is based on focalmechanisms of moderate-magnitude events (𝑀> 4) which are highlysparse since comprised of two clusters within a 500 km radius, namelyreverse faulting in Fort St John and strike–slip faulting in Fox Creek.65We therefore conclude that a normal stress regime, while unexpected,does not contradict existing observations as evidenced by the smallquestion marks in Fig. 2. Fig. 8(e) also indicates the likely existence of atransitional stress regime with comparable 𝜎𝐻and 𝜎𝑣between depths of1900–2050 m, followed by a normal stress regime below this, implyingthat the stress regime may vary with depth.4.6. In-situ stress estimation with all combined constraintsIn the application of horizontal stress calculation using the poro-elastic model with strain corrections by combining all quantitative andqualitative constraints, the lower bound of the maximum horizontalstress magnitude cannot be smaller than the largest minimum bound;while the upper bound cannot be larger than the smallest maximumbound. Therefore, in the Montney Formation around the well A loca-tion, the maximum horizontal stress is between the lower bound (19.9kP/m) and the upper bound (24.2 kPa/m), roughly 20–24 kPa/m.Applying the same methodology and parameters used for the wellA, full in-situ stresses of the Montney Formation were calculated forthe other five wells in the area and are summarized in Table 3.

The upper bound caseis shown in Fig. 13 as an example with calculated in-situ stresses andoccurrences of breakouts or drilling-induced fractures.It is observed from Fig. 13 that values for the occurrences of eitherbreakouts or drilling-induced fractures are far below zero in the Mont-ney Formation, while the breakouts curve (the red curve) is close topositive at the top of the Belloy Formation, which means that breakoutswould likely to occur around these depths (below 2250 m). As observedin the image log of well J (right picture in Fig. 6), many breakoutoccurrences were observed at depths below 2254 m; while breakouts ordrilling-induced fractures were not observed in the Montney Formation.Therefore, for the upper bound case, the in-situ stresses calculationfor the well J verifies the equations and strain correction used for thein-situ stresses calculations in the area.In the case of using the lower bound strain corrections 𝜖ℎand𝜖𝐻for the in-situ stress calculations in well J, the calculated valueof breakout occurrences are negative (below zero although close to),meaning that the chances of breakout occurrences are smaller thanusing the upper bound strain corrections. This is a limitation of thecurrent methodology. The wells on the west are close to the RockyMountains and are affected more by the tectonic movement. Applyingthe same horizontal strain correction factor for all wells in the studyarea will be inappropriate, especially if the area is large. In furtherstudies, it should be considered to assign horizontal strain correctionfactors proportionally to their distances from the Rocky Mountains.5.2. Borehole deformation in anisotropic rocksAs stated, isotropic rock mechanical properties are assumed in thisstudy considering that the major lithologies in the Montney Forma-tion are silts. In isotropic rocks, the stress and strain ellipsoids areidentical.77 In anisotropic rocks, it is possible that the major axes ofthe stress and strain ellipses point in different directions. The wellboreshape reflects the strain ellipsoid of the rock, which could be differentfrom the stress ellipsoid. In the horizontal section of well C, the averageratio of horizontal-to-vertical Young’s moduli is 1.12. To investigate theinfluences of such anisotropic rock mechanical properties on the bore-hole diameter calculations, we consider Vertical Transverse Isotropic(VTI) rock materials and rewrite the borehole diameter Eqs. (7) and(8) by including VTI rock mechanical properties as𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟= 2𝑟𝐸𝑣[(1−2𝜈𝑣𝜈ℎ)𝜎𝐻−(3−2𝜈2𝑣)𝜎𝑣+𝜈𝑣𝜎ℎ+(1+𝜈𝑣)𝑝𝑚+(1−2𝜈𝑣)𝑝𝑝]+2𝑟, (12)and𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟= 2𝑟𝐸ℎ[(1−2𝜈𝑣𝜈ℎ)𝜎𝑣−(3−2𝜈2ℎ)𝜎𝐻+𝜈ℎ𝜎ℎ+(1+𝜈ℎ)𝑝𝑚+(1−2𝜈ℎ)𝑝𝑝]+2𝑟, (13)```"

Han and M. van der Baanwhere, 𝐸𝑣and 𝐸ℎare vertical and horizontal Young’s modulus respec-tively; 𝜈𝑣and 𝜈ℎare vertical and horizontal Poisson’s ratio respectively.Eqs. (12) and (13) are obtained from Equation (A.01) in the appendixby considering a horizontal borehole and by replacing isotropic elasticmoduli by their VTI ones.Following the same procedure for the calculation of borehole diam-eter ratios (𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟/𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟) in isotropic rocks as described in the previoussection for well C, we calculated the ratios using Eqs. (12) and (13) foran anisotropic rock case. The ratios of 𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟and ∕𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟under anisotropicrock conditions are plotted as blue dots in Fig. 12.In this case, the lateral section of the borehole is drilled in thedirection of the minimum horizontal stress. For isotropic rocks, theborehole is circular if the vertical and maximum horizontal stresses areidentical, that is, both the stress and strain ellipses are circles. The ratio(𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟/𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟) becomes less than one for normal faulting stress regimeconditions, where 𝜎𝑣> 𝜎𝐻.For anisotropic rocks, a circular borehole can exist if the verticalstress is less than the maximum horizontal stress but the verticalYoung’s modulus is smaller than the horizontal Young’s modulus, thatis, the strain ellipse is a circle but the stress ellipse is not. We thereforecalculate when a circular borehole would be seen under anisotropicrock properties for this formation (Fig. 12). A ratio (𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟/𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟) lessthan one under strike–slip conditions is only observed for a very smallrange of maximum horizontal stress gradients between 25.3 kP/mand 26.2 kPa/m, yielding ratios of (𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟/𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟) between 0.99986 and1. Predicted ratios (𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟/𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟) decrease monotonically with smallermaximum horizontal stresses (Fig. 12).Given that the observed value is 0.98104, the most likely stressregime for the area is normal faulting, and it is unlikely that the majoraxes of the stress and strain ellipses point in perpendicular directions.To explore under which condition the stress and strain ellipses maybe significantly different, we re-write Eqs. (12) and (13) to a combinedequation as𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟∕𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟=𝜎1𝐸𝑣+ 1𝜎2𝐸ℎ+ 1= 𝐸ℎ𝐸𝑣𝜎1 + 𝐸𝑣𝜎2 + 𝐸ℎ,(14)where 𝜎1 = (1 −2𝜈𝑣𝜈ℎ)𝜎𝐻−(3 −2𝜈2𝑣)𝜎𝑣+ 𝜈𝑣𝜎ℎ+ (1 + 𝜈𝑣)𝑝𝑚+ (1 −2𝜈𝑣)𝑝𝑝,𝜎2 = (1 −2𝜈𝑣𝜈ℎ)𝜎𝑣−(3 −2𝜈2ℎ)𝜎𝐻+ 𝜈ℎ𝜎ℎ+ (1 + 𝜈ℎ)𝑝𝑚+ (1 −2𝜈ℎ)𝑝𝑝.Unless 𝜎1 and 𝜎2 become comparable to the Young’s moduli thenthe 𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟∕𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟ratio should be close to 1 for isotropic stress even foranisotropic rocks, since 𝜎1 and 𝜎2 are in MPa and Young’s moduliin GPa (𝜎≪𝐸). It means that anisotropy in the rock fabric canonly explain the well shape for weak rocks in which case the stressand strain ellipsoids can have opposing major axes. However for stiffsilts stone such as encountered here for the Montney Formation with𝐸ℎ∕𝐸𝑣= 1.12, although the measured borehole diameter ratios are outof the theoretical range in both isotropic and anisotropic rocks, thesmall ratio of 𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟∕𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟= 0.98104 cannot be explained as a strike–slipfault stress regime. Therefore the in-situ stress regime in well A area ismost likely a normal fault stress regime. This is also in agreement withthe observations from the critical stress state analysis in the previoussection.5.3. Quantitative and qualitative constraintsIn this case study, we apply the critical stress state and the pres-ence/absence of borehole breakout and/or tensile drilling-induced frac-tures as quantitative constraints. We use the diameter ratio as a con-straint but do not try to match the actual measured number of boreholeellipticity. The measured borehole ellipticity cannot be used directlyfor a quantitative stress inversion because of the potential of rockcreep effects,78 and/or reduction of the Young’s modulus due to createdfractures.59–61The creep effects and/or a reduced Young’s modulus due to thepresence of fractures may increase the ellipticity, however, it is unlikelyto cause the stress and strain ellipses to have major axes in opposingdirections for stiff isotropic or anisotropic rocks (such as silts withYoung’s modulus of more than 40 GPa in this study), which has beenobserved from the analysis of anisotropic diameter Eqs. (12)–(14). Thecreep effect is the largest for compliant shales.786. ConclusionsDifferent constraint strategies in the estimation of in-situ stresseslead to various upper and lower bounds of the maximum horizontalstress magnitudes. In addition to the calibration with the minimumprincipal in-situ stress measurement data, the maximum horizontalstress can be further constrained quantitatively by the critical stressstate model and occurrences of drilling-induced fractures or break-outs observed from image logs, and qualitatively by borehole shapesmeasured through multi-arm caliper tools.A common consideration for the Montney area is that it is a strike–slip fault stress regime. However, analysis of caliper logs in horizontalwells in the east of the study area reveals a normal fault stress regime.The implication is that in-situ stress estimations explicitly consideringa strike–slip faulting stress regime may produce biased results in theregion for the likelihood of fault reactivation and/or wellbore stabilityanalysis.CRediT authorship contribution statementHongxue Han: Data collection, Data management, Programming,Calculation, Results visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing –review & editing.

Any excess stress will lead to rupture, resettingthe stresses to below the critical stress.26 In this model, the ratio of theminimum and maximum principal stresses (𝜎3 and 𝜎1) can be calculatedfrom the frictional strength of pre-existing fractures and faults. If themagnitude of one of them is known, then the remaining minimum ormaximum principal stress (𝜎3 or 𝜎1) can be assessed.29A third methodology in oilfield practice to predict stresses is theporoelastic model with strain corrections,26,35–37 which is based onthe empirical correlations between rock mechanical properties or rockphysical properties and the values from geophysical sonic and densitylogs.38–41 In this method, in-situ stress profiles are generated withcalibrations by closure pressures of local DFITs. Again, uncertaintiesexist in the maximum horizontal stress magnitude depending on theavailability of constraints (mostly occurrences of breakouts or drilling-induced fractures observed from image logging data). Normally, upperor lower bounds of maximum horizontal stress magnitudes are pro-vided by this methodology. In practice, the uncertainty ranges of theestimated in-situ stresses can be reduced with constraints of boreholemeasurements and geomechanical modelings.27This paper focuses on integrating constraint strategies to reduce theuncertainties in estimating the maximum horizontal stress magnitudein the application of the poroelastic model with strain corrections.More specifically, we apply critical stress state and occurrences∕non-occurrences of breakouts or drilling-induced fractures as quantitativeconstraints, and borehole ellipticity as a qualitative constraint, to nar-row down the range between upper and lower bounds in the estimationof the maximum horizontal stresses.To demonstrate the methodology, we first analyze different con-straint strategies in stress estimations; then, in-situ stress estimationunder quantitative and qualitative constraints is illustrated for a fieldcase, the Kiskatinaw Seismic Monitoring and Mitigation Area (KSMMA)in British Columbia, Canada, where there have been many inducedsceismicities in the past years42,43; and finally, the stress estimationresults and model validity are presented and discussed.2. Constraint strategies in stresses estimations2.1. Poro-elastic model with strain correctionsThe poroelastic model with strain corrections is the most commonlyused methodology in oilfield practice to predict in-situ stresses.26,35–37In an isotropic elastic rock, the horizontal stresses can be computedusing poro-elastic horizontal strain models26,35,44 as𝜎ℎ=𝜈1 −𝜈𝜎𝑣−𝜈1 −𝜈𝛼𝑝𝑝+ 𝛼𝑝𝑝+𝐸1 −𝜈2 𝜖ℎ+𝜈𝐸1 −𝜈2 𝜖𝐻,(1)and𝜎𝐻=𝜈1 −𝜈𝜎𝑣−𝜈1 −𝜈𝛼𝑝𝑝+ 𝛼𝑝𝑝+𝜈𝐸1 −𝜈2 𝜖ℎ+𝐸1 −𝜈2 𝜖𝐻,(2)where 𝜎ℎand 𝜎𝐻are the minimum and the maximum horizontalstresses respectively, 𝜈is Poisson’s ratio, E is Young’s modulus, 𝛼is Biotcoefficient, 𝑝𝑝is pore pressure, and 𝜖ℎand 𝜖𝐻are horizontal strainsalong the minimum and the maximum horizontal stress directionsrespectively.The above horizontal stress equations ((1) and (2)) require verticalstress, rock mechanical properties, pore pressure, and tectonic straininformation as inputs. The magnitude of the vertical stress is generallyassumed equal to the weight of the overlying rock, which can becalculated from the integration of bulk density logs.44Dynamic elastic moduli are generally calculated from compressiveand shear sonic logs, and density logs using correlation equationsdescribed by45𝐺= 𝜌𝑉2𝑠; 𝜆= 𝜌𝑉2𝑠−2𝐺; 𝐸𝑑𝑦𝑛= 𝐺(3𝜆+ 2𝐺)(𝐺+ 𝜆); 𝜈𝑑𝑦𝑛=𝜆2(𝐺+ 𝜆) ,(3)where G and 𝜆are the shear modulus and Lame’s first parameter,respectively; 𝑉𝑝and 𝑉𝑠are compressive and shear sonic velocities; 𝐸𝑑𝑦𝑛and 𝜈𝑑𝑦𝑛are dynamic Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio respectively.The dynamic elastic moduli are then converted to static moduli throughthe relationship established from core mechanical test results.46Pore pressure information can be obtained from DFITs or otherpore pressure data (upon availability). For locations without suitablemeasurements, pore pressures are inferred from sonic logs47–50 basedon calibrations against wells with pore pressure information.The horizontal strain corrections, 𝜖𝐻and 𝜖ℎin Eqs. ((1) and (2)), aredifficult to determine. Measurements of at least one of the local in-situhorizontal stresses are needed to estimate the desired stress or straincorrections.26 The closure pressure estimated from DFITs is generallyused as a calibration of the calculated smallest principal in-situ stress.This is equal to the minimum horizontal stress under a normal or strike–slip stress regime. Such a calibration enables preliminary estimation of𝜖𝐻or 𝜖ℎ. However, uncertainties exist in the estimation of maximumhorizontal stress magnitudes.25,26 More constraints are needed to fur-ther modify the strain corrections 𝜖𝐻and 𝜖ℎ, which will be the subjectof the next sections.2.2. Constraints: Critical stress stateA critical stress state refers to a stress state under which faults at theappropriate angle to the current stress field are mechanically active.29In the critical stress model, preexisting, optimally oriented faults andfractures are at the point of shear failure. Any excess stress will lead torupture, resetting the stresses to below the critical stress.26 The ratioof the effective minimum and maximum principal stresses (𝜎′3 and 𝜎′1)then only depends on the frictional strength of the preexisting faults astheir cohesion is set to zero26,29 and can be described as|𝜎′1||𝜎′3| =(√𝜇2 + 1 + 𝜇)2,(4)where 𝜎′1 = 𝜎1 −𝛼𝑝𝑝and 𝜎′3 = 𝜎3 −𝛼𝑝𝑝are the effective maximum andminimum principal stresses respectively, 𝜇is the coefficient of frictionfor faults or fractures. The magnitude of the friction coefficient 𝜇isgenerally assumed 0.6–1.0 for a wide variety of crustal rocks.29,512.3. Constraints: (Non)-occurrences of breakouts and drilling-induced frac-turesFor a vertically drilled borehole, breakouts might occur at wellborelocations corresponding to the minimum horizontal stress directionif the mud weight is small; while drilling-induced fractures may oc-cur at wellbore locations corresponding to the maximum horizontalstress direction if the mud pressure is sufficiently large. By applyingthe Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion to the Kirsch solutions of thestress distribution around a circular opening in elastic materials,20,44,52the criteria for respectively drilling-induced fracture and/or breakoutoccurrences can be described as𝑝𝑚> 3𝜎ℎ−𝜎𝐻+ 𝜎𝑇𝑆𝑇𝑅−𝛼𝑝𝑝,(5)and(3𝜎𝐻−𝜎ℎ−𝑝𝑚−𝛼𝑝𝑝) > 𝜎𝑈𝐶𝑆+ 𝑡𝑎𝑛2(𝜋4 + 𝜙2) (𝑝𝑚−𝛼𝑝𝑝) ,(6)```"

Han and M. van der Baanrespectively, where 𝜎𝑇𝑆𝑇𝑅stands for rock tensile strength, 𝜎𝑈𝐶𝑆standsfor Unconfined Compressive Strength, 𝜙is the friction angle.(Non)-occurrences of drilling-induced fractures and breakouts canbe used as constraints for the estimation of the maximum horizontalstress magnitudes in cases where the mechanical properties, the forma-tion pore pressure, the minimum horizontal stress, and the drilling muddensity are known using Eqs. (5) and (6). For example, if breakouts areobserved from image logs, the smallest maximum horizontal stress 𝜎𝐻obtained from Eq. (2), that satisfies the constraint condition equation(6), will be a lower bound of the maximum horizontal stress. Con-versely, if no breakout occurrences are observed, the largest maximumhorizontal stress 𝜎𝐻, obtained from Eq. (2), that satisfies the constraintequation (6), will be an upper bound of the maximum horizontal stress.Similarly, if drilling-induced fractures are observed from image logs,the smallest maximum horizontal stress 𝜎𝐻obtained from Eq. (2), thatsatisfies the constraint condition equation (5), will be a lower boundof the maximum horizontal stress. Conversely, if no drilling-inducedfractures are observed, then the largest maximum horizontal stress 𝜎𝐻,obtained from Eq. (2), that satisfies the constraint equation (5), will bean upper bound of the maximum horizontal stress.We will use these lower or upper bounds extensively to validateand verify stress predictions. The constraint is applied to the maximumhorizontal stress 𝜎𝐻, since we assume that the minimum horizontalstress 𝜎ℎ, is already constrained by the closure pressure as describedabove.2.4. Constraints: Borehole shape measurementsFinally, we used the borehole shape as a constraint. Generally, un-der an anisotropic in-situ stress condition, if a well is drilled along oneof the principal stress directions and there are no drilling-induced frac-tures or breakouts observed, the borehole will show an elliptical shape,where the longer diameter corresponds to the smaller in-situ stressdirection, while the shorter diameter corresponds to the larger in-situstress direction. Analytical solutions of radial displacements 𝜇𝑟𝑟aroundthe borehole can be derived from the Kirsch set of equations.44,53 Foreither a vertically or horizontally drilled borehole, if we know theelastic properties of the rock (E and 𝜈), the mud pressure used, oneprincipal stress parallel to the borehole axis direction, and one of theprincipal stresses acting orthogonal on the borehole, theoretically, wecan estimate the magnitude of the other principal stress orthogonal onthe borehole from the measured borehole diameter ratio using boreholedeformation equations (refer to the Appendix for details).For a horizontal borehole drilled parallel to the minimum horizontalstress direction, the two principal in-situ stresses acting orthogonallyon the borehole wall are the vertical stress 𝜎𝑣, and the maximumhorizontal stress 𝜎𝐻, the vertical diameter 𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟and the horizontaldiameter 𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟, can be described as𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟= 2𝑟𝐸[(1 −2𝜈2) 𝜎𝐻−(3 −2𝜈2) 𝜎𝑣+ 𝜈𝜎ℎ+ (1 + 𝜈) 𝑝𝑚+ (1 −2𝜈) 𝛼𝑝𝑝] + 2𝑟,(7)and𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟= 2𝑟𝐸[(1 −2𝜈2) 𝜎𝑣−(3 −2𝜈2) 𝜎𝐻+ 𝜈𝜎ℎ+ (1 + 𝜈) 𝑝𝑚+ (1 −2𝜈) 𝛼𝑝𝑝] + 2𝑟,(8)respectively. where r is the original borehole radius, E is Young’s mod-ulus, 𝜈is Poisson’s ratio, 𝜎𝑣, is the vertical stress, 𝜎𝐻is the maximumhorizontal stress, 𝜎ℎis the minimum horizontal stress, 𝑝𝑚is boreholemud pressure, 𝛼is Biot coefficient, and 𝑝𝑝is formation pore pressure.If the vertical stress and the maximum horizontal stress magnitudesare different, and the medium properties are isotropic, the shorterdiameter indicates the direction of the larger stress and the longerdiameter indicates the direction of the smaller stress when the well isoriented along a principal stress direction. More specifically, when themeasured vertical diameter 𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟is shorter than the horizontal diameter𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟in a well drilled along the minimum horizontal stress direction,the vertical stress will be larger than the maximum horizontal stress,indicating a normal fault stress regime unless the rock is anisotropicwith different horizontal and vertical compressibilities.In practice, it is important to identify whether the borehole shapeis deformed with or without the occurrences of breakouts or washoutswhen estimating stresses from caliper tools.54,55 Therefore, the follow-ing criteria should be followed when using the Eqs. (7)–(8) for in-situstress calculations:• Borehole orientation be horizontal (deviation 90◦± 5◦).• Tool rotation must cease in the zone of enlargement (indicatinggenuine ellipticity).• The smaller caliper reading is close to bit size (i.e., no largewashout)• Caliper difference must be no more than 10% of bit size (i.e., nobreakout).• The length of well section with consistent longer and shorterdiameter directions must be greater than 1 m (to assure a realreading, no rotation).If any of these fail in particular for 4-arm caliper tools, the boreholeshape cannot be used to estimate the stresses. The measured bore-hole diameter and the theoretically calculated borehole diameter aregenerally not the same,53,55–58 because the diameters measured underin-situ conditions could be impacted by the degraded Young’s modulusdue to possible near-wellbore damage.59–61 Therefore, we may notbe able to calculate the exact value of the unknown in-situ principalstress magnitude. However, we can constrain it by the comparisonof the measured and the theoretically calculated borehole diameterratios. Because, according to Eqs. (7)–(8), the unknown principal stressmagnitude is in a linear relationship with the borehole diameter ratio.2.5. Constraints: All combinedFig. 1 details the constraint strategies in a flow chart. In thischart, the Biot coefficient 𝛼is assumed equal to one. We firstly collectand quality control all the available data: sonic (𝑃𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒and 𝑆𝑤𝑎𝑣𝑒),density, image, and calipers logs, core mechanical test data, closureand pore pressures from DFIT, and drilling mud pressure informationto look for obvious outliers, or clipped values. Then, rock mechanicalproperties are calculated using Eqs. (3), (9), and (10) and calibratedby core mechanical test data. The vertical stress is calculated from theintegration of bulk density logs. Next, an initial poro-elastic horizontalin-situ stress model (equal horizontal strain corrections 𝜖𝐻= 𝜖ℎ) isconstructed using Eqs. (1) and (2) and is calibrated with the closurepressure. After that, the maximum horizontal stress is estimated usingEqs. (1) and (2) but with adjusted horizontal strain corrections (𝜖𝐻≠𝜖ℎ), based on the vertical and the minimum horizontal stress from theprevious step, and constrained in turn (as described in the above sub-sections) with (i) the critical stress state (determined using Eq. (4)),(ii) the occurrences of breakouts and induce fractures (using Eqs. (5)or (6) and comparing with observations from image logs), (iii) the in-situ stress regime (determined from observations of either image logsor caliper logging data of horizontal boreholes), and (iv) the boreholediameter (calculated using Eqs. (12) and (13) and compared with mea-surements). Each constraint is applied independently to obtain rangesof possible maximum horizontal stress magnitudes. Finally, after all theconstraints have been applied, the narrowest range of the maximumhorizontal stress will be selected.3.

The rock type of the Montney Forma-tion is a stiff siltstone-shale that covers approximately 130,000 km2in the northeast of British Columbia and the northwest of Alberta.62The area is one of the most productive unconventional hydrocarbonresources in the WCSB.14,16,42,63,64 The goal of the current study isto apply the constraints discussed in the previous section to estimatethe in-situ stresses with reduced uncertainties for wells having DFITclosure pressure and pore pressure information, core test data, imagelog, compressive and shear sonic wave velocity, density, and multi-armcaliper logs. Accurate and precise constraints on the in-situ stress fieldin this area are important as they have an immediate impact on seismichazard and fault reactivation predictions.163.1. Data availabilityThe public database was reviewed through the geoSCOUT data man-agement tool and some additional wells from an anonymous operatorwere also reviewed. The available data are listed in Table 1, wherefrom left to right, the columns are: well name, well type (H standsfor horizontal wells, V stands for vertical wells), DFIT data, core testdata, image log, compressive and shear sonic wave velocity, density,gamma ray, and multi-arm caliper logs. The locations of wells in thecurrent study are shown in Fig. 3. These wells are located southeast ofthe KSMMA (outside the KSMMA). There are no major faults aroundthe well locations,15,66,67 and there are generally not many inducedseismic activities. Most major induced seismic occurrences are insidethe KSMMA.42There are both compressive and shear sonic wave velocity logs,density logs, and gamma-ray logs available for the six vertical wells(wells A, F-J) and two horizontal wells (wells C and D are on the samepad with well A). The four horizontal wells (wells B-E) that are on thesame pad with well A, have DFIT closure pressure and pore pressuredata available, which will be used for the calibration of the estimatedminimum horizontal stress magnitudes.Well A has core triaxial test data, dynamic elastic moduli test data,scratch test data, image, and eight-arm caliper data available; well F hascore triaxial test data, dynamic elastic moduli test data, and Braziliantensile strength test data available; the core triaxial test data from wellG was not used in this study after data quality control because thedensity of core samples is smaller than those read from density logs;well J has image data, four-arm caliper data, core triaxial test data,core dynamic elastic moduli test data, and Brazilian tensile strengthtest data available.3.2. Mechanical propertiesAfter checking the availability and quality control of the requireddata from individual wells, the dynamic Young’s modulus and Poisson’sratio were firstly calculated using Eq. (3). The dynamic Young’s mod-ulus was then converted to the static Young’s modulus using Eq. (9),which were obtained between static and dynamic Young’s moduli of13 samples from three wells (wells A, F, and J). The cross plot and thecorrelation of a power relationship are shown in Fig. 4.

The static Poisson’s ratio is generally assumed to be equal to thedynamic Poisson’s ratio.After calculating the static elastic moduli (Young’s modulus andPoisson’s ratio), the rock strength parameters were calculated, whichwere in turn used for in-situ stress constraints. The Unconfined Com-pressive Strength (UCS), 𝜎𝑈𝐶𝑆, was calculated using a linear relation-ship with the static Young’s modulus,68 which was modified accordingto the core test results in the study area; the tensile strength, 𝜎𝑇𝑆𝑇𝑅, wasconsidered as a fraction of the Unconfined Compressive Strength; thefriction angle 𝜙, was calculated using a modified empirical correlationequation between friction angles and compressive sonic velocities inshale.39,69 The rock strength calculation equations are presented asfollows:𝜎𝑈𝐶𝑆= 0.00255𝐸𝑠𝑡𝑎; 𝜎𝑇𝑆𝑇𝑅= 0.12𝜎𝑈𝐶𝑆; 𝜙= 0.82𝑎𝑟𝑐𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑉𝑝−1000𝑉𝑝+ 1000 ,(10)where 𝑉𝑝is the compressive sonic wave velocity in m/s.The examples of the calculated elastic moduli (static Young’s mod-ulus and Poisson’s ratio) and the UCS values of well A are shownin Fig. 5. The black dots are the core test results and were used ascalibration points. It is observed that the calculated Young’s modu-lus, Poisson’s ratio, and UCS are in reasonable agreement with thecore-tested results.3.3. Maximum horizontal stress directionThe maximum horizontal stress is in the Northeast-Southwestdirection,15,70 which was validated by drilling-induced fractures (par-allel to 𝜎𝐻) or breakouts (perpendicular to 𝜎𝐻) observed from imagelogs of well A and well J. The left picture in Fig. 6 shows the For-mation Micro Imager (FMI) log of well A at depths from 2259 metersto 2264 m. Breakouts in this well showed azimuths of 300 to 310degrees. Induced fractures in this well were interpreted at azimuths ofaround 30 to 35 degrees. Both observations confirm that the estimatedmaximum horizontal stress direction at this location is 30 to 40 de-grees NE. However, the induced fractures and breakouts were foundin formations above or below the Montney Formation. Occurrencesof drilling-induced fractures or breakouts in the Montney Formationwere rare, indicating stronger rocks or smaller in-situ stress magnitudedifferences or both,45 and thus variations in relative stress magnitudeswith depth. There is however no evidence that the stress orientationschange with depth.Similarly in well J (right picture in Fig. 6), the image log showsbreakout occurrences at an azimuth of around 305 (or 125) degrees atdepths from 2254 to 2258 m. The maximum horizontal stress directionis the same as those observed in well A, which is around 30–40 degreesin this area, despite that both wells are approximately 15 km apart(Fig. 3).3.4. In-situ stress regimeAs seen in Fig. 2, the standard consideration of in-situ stress regimein the area is strike–slip faulting, which has also been investigatedby most previous analyses.15,16,65,70–72 In this study, the in-situ stressregime was re-evaluated by analyzing image logs and multi-arm caliperlogging data of horizontal wells in the area. Previous studies analyzedborehole deformation and stress measurements in vertical wells, andthen extrapolated over large distances due to the lack of in-betweenmeasurements.73 Conversely, the addition of borehole deformation inhorizontal wells can help differentiate between normal (𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟< 𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟)fault and strike–slip (𝐶𝑣𝑒𝑟> 𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑟) fault stress regimes based on thecalculation of vertical and horizontal diameters (Eqs. (7) and (8)).The horizontal wells were drilled along the minimum horizontalstress direction in azimuth of around 125 degrees NE.

Conversely, their absence doesprovide constraints on the in-situ stress magnitudes; see Eqs. (5) and(6) for a vertical borehole.Then, the eight-arm caliper logging data in the horizontal sectionsof both wells were reviewed. The caliper tools were oriented and therewere no tool rotations observed in the horizontal section. The orienta-tions of the first pads (pad1 or arm1) pointed downward consistently. Inwell C, it is 161.4–177.6 degrees (average 167.7 degrees) from the topof the horizontal wellbore; in well D, it is 163.3–197.6 degrees (average180.2 degrees) from the top of the horizontal wellbore. Arm pair C15(pad 1 and pad 5) represents, approximately, the vertical diameter ofthe wellbore; arm pair C37 represents, approximately, the horizontaldiameter of the wellbore.As shown in Fig. 7, for example, in well C (caliper logs are plottedin measured depth), the vertical diameter C15 (blue) is shorter thanthe horizontal diameter C37 (orange). The average diameter ratio(C15/C37) is 0.98104 with a standard deviation of 0.01347. Assumingisotropic rock properties, this indicates that the vertical stress is thelargest principal in-situ stress, the maximum horizontal stress is theintermediate principal in-situ stress, and the minimum horizontal stressis the smallest, implying that the in-situ stress regime at locationsaround the east of the study area is a normal fault stress regime. Foranisotropic rocks, the vertical diameter can become smaller than thehorizontal one, even if the largest principal stress is horizontal if therock is soft (compliant) and the vertical compliance (compressibility)is larger than the horizontal one. For this reason, we will consider bothnormal and strike–slip stress regimes. We will revisit this topic in thediscussion.Next, we will illustrate how Eqs. (1) and (2) can be used to estimatein-situ stresses, and Eqs. (4)–(8) as general constraints to validate thepredictions.3.5. DFIT closure and pore pressureTo use the workflow as illustrated in Fig. 1, we need to estimatethe closure and pore pressure from the DFIT pressure versus time datafirst for the pore pressure and minimum principal stress magnitudecalibrations. The most commonly used classic DFIT analysis method iscalled the G-function method.74,75 In this method, the closure pressurecan be picked from the pressure vs G-function time curve around thelocus on the G-function plot where a tangent line from the origin ofthe plot intersects with the semi-log derivative. In this study, closurepressures for wells B, C, D, and E, which are four horizontal wells on thesame pad with well A, were estimated using the G-function method. Theaverage closure pressure gradient ∇𝑝𝑐, is around 17.7 kPa/m, which isassumed equal to the smallest principal stress (the minimum horizontalstress 𝜎ℎin this case) and will be used for calibrating the calculatedminimum horizontal stress magnitudes.If pressures are recorded for a sufficiently long duration after thehydraulic fracture is created and the pump is shut off, the formationpore pressure can be extrapolated from pressure vs time data of theDFIT (Ref. 74 and Ref. 76). In this study, linear flows were observedafter fracture closure in wells B, C, D, and E. Therefore, we used Soli-man’s linear flow equation (Ref. 76) to extrapolate the pore pressuresfor these wells.

The strategiesare based on the commonly used poro-elastic model with strain corrections for in-situ stress estimation.In addition to the calibration of the minimum horizontal stress magnitudes from measurement data, wefurther constrain the magnitude of maximum horizontal stress quantitatively with (i) a critical stress statemodel, (ii) (non)-occurrences of breakout and/or drilling-induced fracture observed from image logs, and (iii)qualitatively with elliptical borehole shapes observed from multi-arm caliper logging data. The methodology isdemonstrated using wells near Dawson Creek, Northeast British Columbia and Northwest Alberta, in WesternCanada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). The uncertainty of the estimated maximum horizontal stress magnitudewas reduced and the range of the maximum horizontal stress was narrowed after the application of theseconstraint strategies. It is also observed that in the east of the study area, the in-situ stress regime is a normalfault stress regime. The presence of a normal fault stress regime is unexpected since a strike–slip fault stressregime is typically considered for the entire region. Yet, analysis of caliper data in two horizontal wells hasconfirmed its presence.1. IntroductionIn-situ stress magnitudes, directions, and their spatial variation areessential parameters in civil engineering, mining, drilling, and hy-draulic fracturing, as well as in understanding and managing incidencesof induced felt seismicity. For example, wellbore stability modeling canbe improved through proper estimations of in-situ stresses.1,2 Therehave been many important implications of in-situ stress for seismo-tectonics, such as earthquake magnitudes,3–5 and their locations6–10 aswell as the likelihood of felt seismicity, for instance, during hydraulicfracturing treatments.11–16In general, to reduce the number of unknowns and because theearth’s surface is relatively flat in most sedimentary basins, threeorthogonal principal in-situ stresses are normally assumed: the verticalstress (𝜎𝑣), the maximum horizontal stress (𝜎𝐻), and the minimumhorizontal stress (𝜎ℎ). Three common stress regimes are defined accord-ing to the relative magnitude of these three principal stresses: normalfaulting stress regime (𝜎𝑣> 𝜎𝐻> 𝜎ℎ), strike–slip faulting stress regime(𝜎𝐻> 𝜎𝑣> 𝜎ℎ), and thrust faulting stress regime (𝜎𝐻> 𝜎ℎ> 𝜎𝑣),17 asreferred to by.18Among the three principal in-situ stresses, the magnitude of thevertical stress (𝜎𝑣) is assumed to be equal to the weight of the overlyingrock and can be calculated from the integration of bulk density logs.∗Corresponding author.E-mail address: hongxue2@ualberta.ca (H. Han).The direction of the horizontal in-situ stresses (𝜎𝐻, 𝜎ℎ, where 𝜎𝐻>𝜎ℎ) can be successfully inferred from borehole wall yield informationsuch as breakouts or drilling-induced tensile fractures, which are oftendetected in acoustic or resistivity image logs.19–23Hydraulic fracturing (HF) is a borehole field-test method designedto assess the magnitude of in-situ stress in the Earth’s crust and HF is theInternational Society for Rock Mechanics and Rock Engineering (ISRM)suggested method for smallest in-situ stress estimations.24 Sometimessmall-scale HF tests, such as a mini-frac test, or a data-frac test, areused. The most popular current method for performing small-scaleHF tests in unconventional resource development is the DiagnosticFracture Injection Test (DFIT). The closure pressure, which is equal tothe minimum principal in-situ stress, can be estimated by analyzing theDFIT pressure versus time curves. For a vertically drilled borehole ineither a normal faulting stress regime or a strike–slip faulting stressregime, the field in-situ stress measurement using hydraulic fracturingapproaches is generally an estimation of the smallest principal in-situstress, which is the minimum horizontal in-situ stress (i.e., 𝜎ℎ= 𝜎3 inthis case).The Maximum horizontal stress magnitude (𝜎𝐻) cannot be mea-sured accurately or precisely.25–27 It is often calculated by using theKirsch equations for a circular elastic opening,28 as referred to by Ref. 29,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gete.2023.100518Received 26 May 2023; Received in revised form 8 September 2023; Accepted 19 November 2023```"

(1) The nonlinear normal stress deformation of the fracture is the main mechanism for characterizing the fracture permeability and heat transfer when the stress ratio falls below a threshold value. As the stress increased, the permeability of the fracture dimin­ished, the optimal permeation path was obscure, and the heat extraction decreased.  (2) When the stress ratio is large enough to induce shear dilation, the shear dilation effect becomes dominant in controlling the stress- induced fracture permeability change. In the direction of the maximum principal stress, the hydraulic aperture of some long fractures increases owing to the shear dilation effect, resulting in an optimal percolation path for the entire fracture network. Moreover, the heat transfer process achieves faster thermal breakthroughs and improved heat extraction efficiency.

Khodaei et al. 15 used FLAC2D based on the finite difference method (FDM) to calculate different stress states of discrete fracture networks in geological media. The discontinuous medium was more realistic than the continuous method model. Min et al. 16 adopted the UDEC of the discrete element method (DEM) and combined it with the concept of random represen­tative elementary volume (REV) to develop a numerical method for determining the equivalent permeability tensor of a fractured rock mass was proposed. Ma et al. 17 proposed an equivalent discrete fracture network (E-DFN) method and used the UDEC to numerically simulate the E-DFN model. The hybrid finite element-discrete element method (FEMDEM), which combines the coordinated finite element and discrete element methods, can be used to simulate fractures and their propaga­tion under stress. Lei et al. 18 used the mixed finite element discrete element method (FEMDEM) to simulate the geo-mechanical behavior of a three-dimensional fractured rock mass under the action of in-situ stress, capturing the deformation of the matrix block and the change in the stress field. Lei and Gao 19 simulated the complex geo-mechanical behavior of heterogeneous fractured rocks based on the FEMDEM method, including the stress/strain of the heterogeneous matrix and the mechanical interaction of discrete blocks. However, the temperature field was not considered in the study of the geomechanics and hydro­dynamic behavior of the fractured rock mass using the above numerical methods; therefore, it is necessary to establish a numerical model considering the anisotropic seepage and heat transfer of the fractured rock mass caused by the geological stress of the fractured rock mass. The seepage field interacts with the temperature field in the frac­tured rock mass inside the geothermal reservoir. The fluid movement in fractures promotes heat exchange between the fluid and rock matrix. The fluid acts as a carrier to influence the temperature of the rock matrix through inflow and outflow7,20–26. Zhou et al.25 presented a discrete fracture model considering variable density and aperture distribution to investigate the performance of a geothermal reservoir in EGS. It was found that the higher variability corresponds to the low heat production rate, and the increase in mean fracture aperture leads to a higher in­crease in heat production rate than an increase in fracture density. Sun et al.7 performed its thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) to simulate the solid deformation, fluid flow and heat transport processes. The results showed a good correlation between the heat extraction efficiency and the fracture network connectivity, with appearing to be a prerequisite for geomechanical factors to impact heat transfer. The geothermal reservoir in EGS is usually subjected to anisotropic in-situ stress, which leads to the closure and dilation of the fractures in the fracture network, and the internal fluid movement exhibits the phenomenon of chan­neling; that is, most of the fluid will flow along a small part of the fracture 6, leading to anisotropic heat transfer in the fracture network. However, few studies consider the nonlinear fracture normal stress-deformation relationship and shear dilation effect on the perfor­mance of geothermal reservoir. Barton et al. 8 established a model for describing the nonlinear constitutive relation of fractures. Min et al. 16 proposed a simplified nonlinear constitutive model based on Barton-Bandis. Sun et al.27 studied the combines effects of thermal perturbation and in-situ stress on heat transfer in fracture network through by THM model considering nonlinear fracture deformation. The results showed shear dilation is trigger by transient cooling effect under the anisotropic in-situ stress condition. Zhang et al.28 developed a THM model considering the nonlinear fracture deformation, which investi­gate the interactive effect of shear dilation and THM coupling processes. It was found that fractures can undergo shear dilation due to transient pore pressure changes and thermal stress, especially under anisotropic in-situ stress conditions, which can lead to significant flow channeling and anisotropic heat transfer. Although the above results have consid­ered the nonlinear deformation of stress-induced fractures, they primarily focus on shear dilation of fractures caused by transient ther­mal stresses. The nonlinear deformation gap of fractures induced by different in-situ stresses has not been extensively explored. Therefore, quantitatively characterizing the anisotropic heat transfer induced by nonlinear deformation of fractures under various in-situ stress condi­tions is crucial for evaluating and optimizing the heat extraction process of EGS. Herein, the rigid body spring method is combined with the discrete fracture model to establish a hydraulic coupling numerical model of the fracture network, considering the effect of in situ stress, and the FEM method is used to study the influence of the normal nonlinear defor­mation of the fracture and the dilatancy effect on the thermal recovery process of the EGS. The rigid body spring method (RBSM) is a discrete element method suitable for static small deformation problems to describe the expansion and fracture of viscous brittle materials and is widely used in geotechnical engineering 29–31. This study applies the nonlinear constitutive model proposed by Min et al. 16, which accurately captures the nonlinear normal stress-deformation relationship, tangen­tial slip damage, and shear dilation effects to describe the mechanical behavior of fractures. Through a series of numerical simulations, we systematically analysed the change in the fracture network’s aperture field under anisotropic in-situ stress and water pressure. We revealed the channeling phenomenon and anisotropic heat transfer in the fracture network and finally evaluated and quantified the EGS heat extraction efficiency index under in situ stress. As an innovative contribution, the purpose of this paper is to inves­tigate the effects of in-situ stress on the heat extraction performance of EGSs. This study establishes a hydraulic coupling numerical model of the fracture network considering the effect of in-situ stress. Then the finite element method is used to study the influence of in-situ stress on the heat extraction performance of EGSs. Through a series of numerical experiments, the changes in the aperture field of the fracture network under the conditions of anisotropic in-situ stress are systematically analyzed, and the seepage phenomenon and anisotropic heat transfer of the fracture network are revealed. Finally, the effect of in situ stress on the EGSs heat extraction performance is evaluated and quantified. 2. Rock deformation analysis: the rigid-body spring method 2.1. Basic theory This study utilise the rigid body spring method 32. In this model, the deformation capacity of the rock matrix is negligible when compared to the deformation capacity of the rock interfaces. The elastic properties of the interface between adjacent blocks are mainly characterised by the normal stiffness knand the tangential stiffness ks. The relationship be­tween the local stress on the interface and the relative displacement on boundary, is shown in Fig. 1. The relationship between stress and rela­tive displacement at the interface is expressed as {σ} = [D]{Δu}(1)  where{σ}T = {σn, σs},σn andσs denote the normal and tangential Fig. 1.

The global equilibrium equation was obtained as follows: [K]{U} = {Q}(3)  where [K] is the overall stiffness matrix, {U} is the total relative displacement vector, and {Q} is the total force vector. The expressions for these quantities can be found in 32. 2.2. Nonlinear constitutive model for rock fractures In the traditional rigid-body spring approach, a linear constitutive model of a fracture is generally used. However, this model cannot describe nonlinear behavior in fractures such as the relationship be­tween normal stress and displacement, and is unsuitable for hydrody­namic coupling analysis. To describe the fracture deformation characteristics under stress more realistically and accurately, a simpli­fied Barton–Bandis model is required (Min et al. 16). The model consists of three parts: a step-linear relationship between normal stress and normal deformation (Fig. 2a), an elastoplastic relationship between shear stress and shear deformation (Fig. 2b), and a shear dilation effect (Fig. 2c). In order to facilitate the calculation and superior simulation performance, a modification is made here: the unloading relationship was consistent with the normal loading relationship. The tangential and normal deformations of the fracture are divided into elastic and plastic deformations, denoted as {Δu} = {Δu}e + {Δu}p(4)  where{Δu} ={ΔunΔus}T,{Δu}e ={ΔuenΔues}T,{Δu}p ={ΔupnΔups}T.{Δu}e is the elastic deformation, which represents the relative normal displacement and relative tangential displacement. {Δu}p represents the relative normal displacement due to the shear dilation effect and relative tangential displacement due to slip. Four conditions are required to solve the fully elastic–plastic problem: in­cremental stress–strain relationship, flow criterion, yield criterion, and continuity condition. The nonlinear transient model is introduced as follows.  (1) Incremental stress–strain relationships (as shown in Fig. 2a and 2b) {Δσ} = [D]{Δue} + {M}(5)  where [D] =[kn00ks](6)  kn is the step normal elastic stiffness, which is divided into three values, according to the normal elastic deformation, by σn1, σn2, σn3, un1,un2, and un3 to determine (as in Fig. 2a)  (2) Associated flow laws (as shown in Fig. 2c) Shear dilation follows slip, and the shear dilation effect can be expressed as: Δunp = |Δusp|⋅tanψ(7)  whereψ is the shear dilation angle. According to the law of un­correlated flow, the relationship can be expressed as {Δup} = λ{tanψ±1}(8)  whereλ is the coefficient of proportionality, and± is deduced from the sign of the absolute value in Eq. (14).  (3) Yield conditions The Mohr-Column criterion is applied here as a yield condition for slip. F(σ) = |τs| + σntanϕ −C = 0(9)  where σn andτs are the normal and shear stresses, respectively, and ϕ and C are the internal friction angle and cohesion of the fracture, respectively. Assume that the tensile strength of the fracture is 0. The yield condition for tensile damage is F(σ) = σn(10)    (4) Continuity conditions Assume that at step t, the stress state is {σ}, and in the yield plane, F(σ) = 0; at stept + dt, stress is applied from the yield surface outward {Δσ}, making the stress state {σ} + {Δσ}. Because the stress state cannot be removed from the yield surface, the {σ} +{Δσ} yield condition must still be satisfied. F(σ + Δσ) = 0(11) Expanding the above using Taylor’s formula while ignoring higher- order terms gives the following continuity condition: {∂F∂σ}T{Δσ} = 0(12) Following tensile damage, the stress is completely relaxed, and en­ergy is fully released. When slip occurs, the plastic stiffness matrix can be resolved. [D]p =1kntanφ⋅tanψ + ks[kn2tanφ⋅tanψ±knkstgψ±knkstgψks2](13) During the iterative process, the stress state of the next step is un­known. Because kn is a nonlinear coefficient related to the stress state [D]p is not easily determined from Eq. (20) when slip occurs. From the relationship between stress and elastic strain, the continuity condition is Fig. 2. Nonlinear constitutive relationship of the fracture.  Y.

Seepage control equation The model is based on three assumptions for seepage calculations: (1) the fluids are incompressible, (2) the rock matrix is dense and impermeable, and (3) the seepage obeys Darcy’s law. The expression for the flow rate q in a single fracture ij,qijs is given by 33: qij =gd3f12μhi −hjlij(15)  where μ is the hydrodynamic viscosity, anddf is the fracture aperture; hi and hj are the hydraulic head at each end of the fissure, and lij is the fissure length. The global equilibrium equations for the seepage simu­lation can be obtained by combining the equilibrium equations at all crossings. The fracture aperture for the stress state can be calculated from the following equation. df = d0 + Δun(16)  whered0 is the initial aperture of the fracture, andΔun is the normal displacement produced under stress. Notably, the aperture under stress may differ for the two ends of the fracture. In this case, the cubic law is no longer applicable because the two fissure faces are not parallel to each other. Considering this case, the equivalent hydraulic aperture is used for de, following the method of 34, de = dm[16r2(1 + r)4]13(17)  wherer = d1/d2,dm = (d1 + d2)/2,d1 andd2 represent the hydraulic apertures at the two ends of the fissure, respectively. From the equiva­lent hydraulic aperturesde we can obtain the fissure permeability coef­ficientkf = de2/12. 4. Controlling equation of temperature field The temperature field in the rock matrix characterizes the heat transfer process in accordance with the following energy conservation equation 35: (ρCp)eff∂Ts∂t + ρCpμ • ∇T + ∇• q = Qmd(18)  where q = −λeff ∇T(19)  (ρCp)eff = εpρpCp.p(20)  λeff = εpλp +(1 −εp)λ + λdisp(21)  whereT is the temperature, Cp is the specific heat capacity of the fluid,λ is the thermal conductivity of the fluid, λp is the thermal conductivity of the rock matrix, εp is the porosity of the rock matrix, ρp is the density of the rock matrix, Qmd is the heat source item, and Cp.p is the specific heat capacity of the rock matrix.

Further, Tfup =Tfbottom. In this study, to evaluate the performance of geothermal extraction, the relative temperature is used as an indicator of heat extraction per­formance which is defined as 27: T∗= Tout −T0Tin −T0(28)  where Tout and Tin represent the average temperature of outlet fluid and inlet fluid, respectively, and T0 is the initial temperature of the rock matrix. 5. Numerical calculation methods for coupling The coupling process was implemented using a cross iterative approach. For computational. convenience, the fracture hydraulic aperture was made equal to the mechanical aperture. The coupling process is illustrated in Fig. 3. Step 1. A domain search technique was used to detect all the blocks and the connected fracture network formed by the intersection of the fractures. Here, the number of cycles is represented by a factor s, and the initial value is set to 0. Step 2. Using the fracture network obtained in step 1, seepage analysis is performed to obtain the flow field. The water pressure on the fissure boundary is analysed based on the flow field, and the exact al­gorithm can be 34 established. Step 3. The water pressure is applied, with boundary conditions on the whole block system, and the deformation of each fissure is analysed. Afterward, the equivalent aperture of the fissure after deformation is Fig. 3. Flow chart of calculation.  Y.

Model setup In this study, we follow the discrete fracture network model 16,32. A square two-dimensional discrete fracture model with a length of 5 m × 5 m (as shown in the EGS model of the discrete fracture network model in Fig. 4), which is above the representative elementary volume (REV) size, was developed from the field measurement features in the Sellafield area of Cumbria, UK 16. The boundaries and meshing of the model are shown in Fig. 5. A parameter K is defined to describe the ratio between the horizontal stress and the vertical stress. To investigate the effect of different stress states on heat transfer process, eight values of K were used in this study: 0:0;5:5,5:10;5:15;5:20;10:5;15:5; and 20:5 in MPa The water head gradient was set to 1 m/m32. which is equivalent to the hydraulic gradient of 1 × 104 Pa/m36. The initial fracture hydraulic aperture was set to 30 µm. The mechanical parameters of the fractures are listed in  Table 1. The rigid-body spring method is used to obtain the flow field as well as the hydraulic aperture of each fracture in the discrete fracture network, which is then used for heat transfer calculations in fracture. The hydraulic gradient of the fracture network was reset for computa­tional convenience as well as to highlight the effect of stress effects on heat transfer. In this study, the heat transfer part of the computational parameters reported in Sun et al.27 were used, The burial water pressure was set to 45 MPa, and the inlet and outlet water pressures were 55 MPa and 45 MPa, respectively. The initial reservoir temperature was 200 ◦C; the inlet temperature was set to 30 ◦C. The input parameters for the rock matrix and fluid are shown in Table 2. 7. Results 7.1.

The magnitude of the flowrate was determined by the thickness and color of the lines. These signs indicated that as the corresponding line of a fracture be­comes thicker and the color changes from green to blue, orange, and red, the flowrate in the fracture increases. Fractures with very low flowrate are not shown; in this two-dimensional analysis, they have little effect on the overall fluid flow field. Accordingly, there are many gaps in cases with K = 15:5 and K = 20:5. The basic features and trends of the flowrate distribution at different stress states are similar to those reported by Min et al. and Zhao et al. 36. As shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, Larger fracture aperture corresponds to Higher flow rates under a con­stant hydraulic gradient. The flowrate decreases with increasing stress for K = 5:5, K = 5:10, and K = 10:5. When the ratio of the horizontal stress to the vertical stress gradually increases, for instance, K = 5:15, K = 15:5, K = 5:20, and K = 20:5, the variation in the fracture flow is not uniform with increasing stress, and the flow in the fracture perpendic­ular to the direction of the principal stress gradually decreases, and the variation in flow gradually flattens with increasing stress. In contrast, larger flows are observed in fractures that are almost parallel to the direction of the principal stress, greatly affecting the seepage path. This trend becomes increasingly evident with the increasing stress ratio. The following mechanisms are responsible for these phenomena. When the ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses is not sufficient to induce shear dilation in fractures, all fractures remain frictionally stable, and Table 3 Physical property parameters of fluid for calculations.

In this case, the fracture hydraulic aperture decreases, leading to a decrease in perme­ability due to the normal closure of the fractures, which is caused by the increase in normal stress. When the stress ratio reaches the threshold of causing the shear dilation effect of the fractures, some fractures almost parallel to the principal stress direction will undergo shear sliding, resulting in the shear dilation effect the aperture of the fractures in­creases significantly, and the permeability increases. Therefore, the shear dilation effect becomes the main mechanism controlling the permeability variation of fractures. Furthermore, dilation is mainly concentrated in a small fraction of the fractures almost parallel to the direction of the maximum principal stress, whereas the rest of the fracture population, especially the subvertical fractures, remain in a normally closed state without any dilation. This leads to a large varia­tion in the hydraulic aperture among fractures. Therefore, a few frac­tures with a high hydraulic aperture become the main local fluid seepage paths, and this trend becomes more pronounced with increasing stress ratio. 7.2. Heat transfer performance Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the temperature distribution at 5 h,10 h,15 h, and 20 h for K = 5:5 and K = 5:20. Evidently, the K = 5:5 and K = 5:20 thermal fronts gradually penetrated the hot rock masses as time progressed. The temperature evolution with time is given here for K = 5:5 and K = 5:20. Comparing K = 5:5 with K = 5:20, it can be seen that the thermal front of K = 5:5 advances gradually and uniformly toward the outlet, and the thermal breakthrough takes longer, whereas the thermal front of K = 5:20 exhibits nonuniformity, with a more prominent and tapered thermal front and an earlier thermal breakthrough. The hydraulic apertures are almost parallel to the vertical fractures, and they are larger than those in the K = 5:5 case when K = 5:20 because the increase in vertical stress causes shear dilation in the frac­tures almost parallel to the vertical direction. In contrast, the hydraulic apertures in the fractures in other directions are not significantly different in the K = 5:5 and K = 5:20 cases. These large apertures in the main fracture group create preferential seepage paths, allowing more fluids to seep into and through the entire rock mass more easily and the thermal front to reach the outlet earlier, which also leads to in­homogeneity in the thermal front surface and evident cone of the ther­mal front in the K = 5:20 case. Fig. 9 shows the temperature profiles along the middle section (Y=0) of K = 5:15 at different times. It can be seen from the figure that the temperature distribution shows inhomogeneity along the middle section and has an obvious thermal front. To illustrate this curve, we set the trough of the temperature distribution as 1# and the peak as 2# (see Fig. 8). On the temperature distribution curve of each period, the 1# area is the lowest temperature, and the 2# area is the highest temper­ature. In the 1# area, with the increase in working time, the thermal front gradually changes from sharp to smooth, t = 10 h is the sharpest, t = 20 h ranks second and t = 30 h is the smoothest. However, the thermal front in 2# area with working time is opposite to that of 1#. The main mechanism for the above phenomenon is the deformation effect of anisotropic in-situ stress on the fracture network. The anisotropic in-situ stress leads to the phenomenon of fracture closure and dilation, which causes the aperture of each fracture in the fracture network to be different. The fracture seepage and heat transfer depend on the fracture aperture. This results in a nonuniformity of temperature distribution at each period. In the 1# area, the in-situ stress causes the dilation effect of some fractures in this area, resulting in an increase in the aperture. As a result, more fluid flows into the region, the temperature drops faster, the thermal front arrives faster, and the low-temperature region expands Fig. 8.

However, some fractures in the 2# area are closed under the in-situ stress, and the temperature decreases slowly. The changing trend of the thermal front in the 1# area is opposite to that in the 2# area. This phenomenon is mainly due to the dilation effect of the fractures, which causes most of the fluid to concentrate in the 1# fracture area. It promotes the 1# fracture area as the major flow path. Fig. 10 shows the evolution of temperature distribution with different stress ratio at t = 10 h. As shown in the figure, for K = 0:0, the thermal front has already reached the outlet. In terms of distance trav­eled by thermal front, K = 5:20 ranks second, followed by K = 5:15, K = 5:5, K = 5:10, K = 20:5, K = 15:5, and K = 10:5. Generally, stress causes a reduction in hydraulic aperture due the normal closure of fractures. However, due to the nonlinear characteristics of normal deformation, after the stress increases to a certain extent, the effect of increasing stress on the normal aperture will become smaller. That is why the thermal front of K = 5:10 is almost the same as which of K = 5:5. With the stress ratio becomes larger, the effects of shear dilation on hydraulic aperture become dominant, and the subvertical large fractures provide preferential pathways to the flow, causing the thermal front to advance rapidly. Fig. 11 shows the evolution of outlet temperature, mass flow rate, and relative temperature under different stress ratios. For Fig. 11(a), the temperature was monitored for the bottom outlet boundary. As shown in Fig. 11(a) the outlet temperature decreases fastest for K = 0:0, followed by which for K = 5:20, K = 5:15, K = 5:5, K = 5:10, K = 10:5, K = 15:5 and K = 20:5. The difference between the outlet temperature line at K = 5:5 and K = 5: 10 is relatively small, with a slight shift to the right at K = 5:10 compared to which at K = 5:5. The mass flow rate is higher for K = 5:5 than for K = 5:10. The reason for this phenomenon can be explained by the evolution of mass flow rate at the bottom outlet boundary. As can be seen from Fig. 11(b), the largest total mass flow is at the stress ratio of K = 0:0, followed by K = 5:20, K = 5:15, K = 5:5, K = 5:10, K = 10:5, K = 15:5, K = 20:5 in order. The relative temperature curves for different stress ratios are shown in Fig. 11(c). The relative temperature T∗is varied between 0 and 1 depending on heat extraction performance. As the vertical stress in­creases, the relative temperature T∗curve first shifted to the right for K = 5:5 and K = 5:10. After that, when the vertical stress continued to increase to 15 MPa and 20 MPa, the curve gradually shifted to the left. In contrast, as the horizontal stress increases from K = 5:5, K = 10:5, K = 15:5, to K = 20:5, the relative temperature T∗curve gradually shifts to the right. Because thermal mining performance is influenced by the flow field, the difference in the heat extraction curve under different stress condi­tions can be explained as follows. The normal closure of the fracture is the dominant parameter controlling fracture seepage and heat transfer. Comparing K = 5:5, K = 5:10, and K = 10:5, the increase in stress leads to a lower hydraulic aperture in the fracture and lower flow rates. However, there is no significant difference in the overall total flowrate (K = 5:5 vs. K = 5:10 in Fig. 6), nor is there a significant difference in the outlet temperature and thermal breakthrough curve compared with K = 5:5 when K = 5:5 slightly shifts to the right, and the heat extraction performance is weakened. In the case of K = 5:15, K = 5:20, K = 15:5, and K = 20:5, when the shear dilation effect caused by fracture sliding becomes the main mechanism controlling the heat transfer by fracture seepage, the hydraulic aperture of the fracture that is almost parallel to the main stress direction gradually increases, and the flow rate increases significantly compared with the curves of K = 5.5, K = 5:10, K = 5:15, and K = 5:20. Under stress, the heat extraction gradually shifts to the left as the stress increases, when comparing the curves for K = 10:5 and K = 15:5 with K = 20:5. The increase in horizontal stress causes shear dilation, and in some fractures whose direction is almost parallel to the horizontal direction, the hydraulic apertures increase and the heat in­trudes faster. However, the fracture apertures in the vertical direction gradually decrease, and the heat extraction decreases. In addition, because only the seepage heat transfer along the bottom boundary of the vertical fractures was monitored in this study—the other lateral boundaries were not—more fluid flowed out of the lateral boundaries due to shear dilation in the horizontally oriented fractures as the hori­zontal stresses increased; therefore, the curves with K = 10:5, K = 15:5, and K = 20:5 were shifted to the right, with the shifts increasing and then decreasing due to the nonlinear normal stress- deformation relationship. 8. Discussions Our simulation highlights the critical importance of incorporating geomechanical stress into geothermal performance modeling. In-situ stress determines the state of geological reservoirs. When the ratio of the horizontal stress to the vertical stress is lower than the threshold, the fracture deformation is dominated by nonlinear normal closure. At this Fig. 10.

When the stress ratio is large enough to induce shear dilation, it eventually leads to the development of a highly permeable fracture network and has a strong effect on heat extraction performance, resulting in greater production flow and faster thermal breakthrough. In previous EGS models, only the linear deformation of fractures is usually considered, and the effect of in-situ stress is not significant. Our results show that to better predict the performance of EGS, the effects of nonlinear normal deformation and dilation effects must also be considered. Our current study provides a practical guide to the heat extraction performance of EGS. The region with high permeability and relatively high stress is selected as the stress condition because of the formation of a hydraulic aperture in the main fracture group due to the shear dilation effect. This is almost parallel to the direction of primary stress and creates an optimal seepage channel; thus, the injection and extraction inlet should be perpendicular to the main fracture group to allow fluid and heat to penetrate into the large fracture geothermal reservoir, thus optimising the heat extraction performance. However, this study does not consider the thermal stress caused by temperature difference. As a matter of fact, thermal stress is primarily generated horizontally due to the confined nature of rock, resulting in thermal shear characterized by fracture shear and dilation, which in turn, enhancing the permeability of fractures37. Zhao et al.38 established a 3D THM coupled model to simulate the heat extraction in HDRs. It was founded that the seepage resistance gradually decreases due to the effects of thermal stress. Koh et al.39 showed that the permeability of fractured reservoir increases due to the long-term cold water injection. Although thermal stress plays a crucial role in THM processes in fractured geothermal reservoirs, considering thermal stress in the RBSM remains a challenge. Addition­ally, this research needs to further consider the scale factors and be extended to three-dimensional heat loss and progressive damage in order to solve more practical problems. 9. Conclusions In this study, a numerical model of the hydro-mechanical coupling and heat-flow transfer in a complex fracture network was developed by combining the rigid-body spring method, discrete fracture network model, and heat transfer method. The effect of fracture shear dilation on the heat extraction performance of the EGS was evaluated. A nonlinear constitutive model for fracture deformation was used, in which nonlinear normal stress–deformation relations, tangential slip, and shear dilation effects were considered. A discrete fracture network established with field data in the Sellafield area of Cumbria, UK is used as an example to investigate the effect of in situ stress on fracture fluid Fig. 11.

This study focuses on the influence of the nonlinear deformation and dilation effect of fractures on the geothermal system under the action of in-situ stress. By adopting a nonlinear constitutive model of rock fractures and embedding discrete fracture networks, numerical studies are first conducted to investigate the effects of different in-situ stress schemes on fracture aperture evolution using a rigid-body spring method. Based on the anisotropic aperture field of the fracture network caused by the in-situ stress, a finite element method is then used to study the flow and heat transfer process. The effects of different stress schemes on the heat flow transfer process are analyzed. Numerical simulation results show that when the ratio of horizontal to vertical stresses is not sufficient to cause shear dilation effects, the nonlinear normal deformation is the main factor affecting flow and heat transfer. In this case, the heat extraction efficiency is reduced. As the stress ratio increases, the shear dilation gradually becomes the dominant mechanism, and the heat extraction performance is improved. The obtained results provide a practical guide for geothermal site siting and optimizing heat extraction efficiency in geothermal reservoirs.   1. Introduction Geothermal energy from hot dry rock has long been considered a new energy source to replace traditional fossil fuels. It is stored in hot dry rock at depths of more than 3 km and temperatures of more than 150 ◦C. Moreover, it is a renewable and clean energy source with great development potential 1,2. Heat extraction from geothermal reservoirs is mainly achieved by cooling circulation fluid between injection and production in high-permeability fracture networks. As the most effective method for mining hot dry rock, EGS formation and research on EGS thermal mining have grown in importance. The geo-mechanical concept of fracture extension induced by hy­draulic stimulation has been successfully implemented in EGS through massive water injection at pressures below the minimum principal stress to increase the hydraulic aperture of the fracture and the connectivity of the fracture network 3–5. During EGS extraction, geological reservoirs are usually subjected to influences that promote shear dilation effects, which control the flow path, such as anisotropic in-situ stress and fracture propagation 6,7. The deformation mechanism of the fracture network is dominated by the shear effect, the concentration of most of the water in a few fractures caused by shear dilation effects promotes the formation of major flow paths 8,9, and heat exchange in the EGS is closely related to the flow field within fractured geothermal rock res­ervoirs 10,11. Notably, the permeability of the rock matrix in geothermal reservoirs is negligible; therefore, the flow field inside the reservoir is dominated by the fracture network. The hydraulic aperture of a fracture is the main determinant of its permeability. The greater the hydraulic aperture, the stronger the permeability. Stress causes macroscopic ten­sion, compression, and dilation of the fracture, which significantly changes the hydraulic aperture and affects the seepage field. The frac­ture shear effect under high in-situ stress is the main mechanism for the evolution of seepage heat transfer characteristics in deep thermal reservoirs. In recent years, the geo-mechanical and hydrodynamic behavior of fractured rock masses has been studied using numerical methods to construct discrete fracture networks12–14.

The effect of organic matter distribution on stress variation This section analyzes the effect of the different organic matter dis­tribution in two regions on the stress alteration angle. fk1 and fk2 represent the organic matter content in the Region #1 and Region #2, respectively. To ensure a more intuitive comparison, we set fk1 =fk2 = 0.05 as the base case, which can also illustrated by the x-axis. The other two cases are fk1 = 0.05, fk2 = 0 and fk1 = 0, fk2 = 0.05. As shown in Fig. 14, the alteration angle of the maximum horizontal principal stress at the monitoring point for fk2 > fk1 is larger than that for fk1 = fk2 in the first 200 days. Similarly, the alteration angle of the maximum horizontal principal stress at the monitoring point for fk2 < fk1 is larger than that for fk1 = fk2 in the first 50 days. Combined the results from Fig. 11 and Fig. 14, it can be obtained that the higher the mass fraction of organic matter, the larger the alteration angle of maximum horizontal principal stress caused by the production. The reason is that the deformation of different regions is not coordinated, which generates shear strain and shear stress at the interface of the two regions (near the monitoring point) when fk1 ‡ fk2. While the direction of the maximum horizontal principal stress can be calculated by Θ =τxy/(σx −σy)Guo et al., ($year$). Therefore, the alteration angle of horizontal principal stress for fk1 ‡ fk2 are greater than that for fk1 = fk2 at the initial production stage. As production proceeds, the total rock strain increases, so the uncoordinated deformations between Region#1 and Region#2 can be neglected. Since then, the alteration angle of horizontal principal stress for fk1 ‡ fk2 are smaller than that for fk1 = fk2. Comparing the results in Fig. 14 and Fig. 15, the effect of different organic matter distribution on the alteration angle and volume strain at the monitoring point is almost the same. 4.3. The effect of organic matter content for fracture propagation in the infill-well Considering that fracture propagation after hydraulic fracturing is affected when the stress in the infill-well region is changed. Therefore, we adopted the DDFM method 49 to simulate the fracturing in infill-well. The fracturing simulation started after 900 days of production, and the fracturing method was bottom-up sequential fracturing with a fracturing fluid viscosity of 1 mPa⋅s. The discharge rate is 6 m3/min, and the fracturing time is set as 30 min Fig. 16 ~18 show the results of fracture propagation in the infill-well considering the magnitude of organic matter content. Fig. 16 shows the results of fracture propagation in the infill-well when fk1 is the same with fk2. A comparison results from Fig. 16a ~ Fig. 16c show that the degree of hydraulic fracture bending in the infill- well slightly decreases as the organic matter content decreases. As shown in Fig. 16d, the total fracture length in the infill-well increases as the organic matter content decreases, which also indicate fracturing works better and thus a greater shale gas production will be obtained. The results of fracture propagation in the infill well when fk1 is lower than fk2 are shown in Fig. 17. As can be seen that when the mass fraction of organic matter (fk) in the infill-well region is 0.05, the degree of fracture bending in the infill-well is minimal compared to that when fk is 0.08 and 0.1. Furthermore, when the mass fraction of organic matter in the infill-well region increases to 0.08, the fracture morphology changes significantly and the degree of fracture bending increases. As shown in Fig. 17d, the total fracture length of the infill-well increases as the mass fraction of organic matter in the infill-well region decreases. The results of fracture propagation in the infill-well when fk1 is greater than fk2 are shown in Fig. 18. Combining the results from Fig. 18a ~Fig. 18c, it shows that the fracture morphology in the infill- well are almost unchanged as the mass fraction of organic matter var­ies. Similarly, it can be concluded that the total fracture length in the infill-well slightly increases as the mass fraction of organic matter de­creases, which also indicates that the fracture propagation in the infill- well is virtually unaffected by the parent wells when the infill-well re­gion contains little or no organic matter. Fig. 19 exhibits the effect of the total fracture length in the infill-well considering the different mass fraction of organic matter. It can be ob­tained that the total fracture length in the infill-well is maximum when fk2 is larger than fk1 and the mass fraction of organic matter (fk) is set as 0.05. However, the total fracture length in the infill-well is maximum when fk1 is larger than fk2 and the mass fraction of organic matter (fk) is as large as 0.1. The effect of the cumulative gas production after 300 days of the infill-well with different fracture networks is shown in Fig. 20. It is obvious that the variation of the gas production is the same as that of the total fracture length in the infill-well, which also indicates that the longer the total fracture length of infill-well, the larger the gas cumu­lative production of the infill-well. 5. Conclusions In this paper, a fully coupled numerical model to simulate the inte­gration of production and fracturing processes in organic-rich shale gas reservoir is proposed. Through numerical validation and sensitivity analysis, the results obtained show that the production in parent wells can result in the changes in the stress field and thus affect the fracture propagation. Furthermore, the mass fraction of organic matter can affect effectively the fracturing effect in infill-well, which in turn affects the production of shale gas wells. The specific conclusions can be summarized:  (1) The proposed integrated numerical method can capture the entire flow spectrum of shale gas reservoir development, which is essential for optimizing fracturing schemes in infill wells and enhancing reservoir recovery.  (2) For shale formations contained organic matter, the rock volume strain and the direction of the maximum principal stresses will change and the degree of change increases with organic matter content due to the shrinkage of organic matter. (3) The existence of organic matter has a significant impact on hy­draulic fracturing effectiveness of infill wells. Organic matter contained in the infill wells region not only changes the direction of hydraulic fracture propagation, but also its content has an opposite effect on the total fracture length and gas cumulative production.

Considering different numerical methods focus on solving different problems, it is difficult to simulate the continuous production and fracturing process with single method. Therefore, two different numerical methods are adopted to simulate the production process and the fracturing process separately in most cases 27. Gakhar et al., 18 adopted the finite element method (FEM) and UFM method for simulating the production process in the parent wells and fracture propagation in the infill-wells, respectively. Unlike the method of Gakhar et al., 18, the DDM method is proposed to simulate the fracture propagation in the infill-wells in study of Guo et al. 21. Masouleh et al., 32 first presented a single method to simulate the production and fracture propagation process based on DDM-based method. Wei et al., 49 pro­posed a fluid-solid coupling method to describe the hydraulic fracture propagation based on Camacho and Ortiz’s meshing method (1996). But the effect of organic matter failed to be considered in their models. In this paper, we adopt an integrated numerical method modified from Wei’s model (2021) to capture the entire flow spectrum of shale gas, including the gas production in parent wells and fracture propa­gation in infill-well. Furthermore, our results obtained from simulating the consolidation problem and a single fracture propagation problem are verified against the analytical solution and commercial software, respectively. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is performed to determine the effect of organic matter content on infill-well hydraulic fracturing. 2. Numerical method considering integrated production and fracturing process The simulation of integrated production and fracturing process consists of two main processes: the first is to simulate the production process of parent wells and obtain the stress field as the initial state. The second process is to predict the fracture propagation in infill-well based on the results from the first process. 2.1. Governing equations for the production process In this section, the shale rock deformation and gas flow involved in the production process is a typical fluid-solid coupling process, which results in the stress variation in the formation. The corresponding weak equations and discretized FEM equations are shown in Appendix A. 2.1.1. Shale rock deformation Considering the presence of organic matters, the constitutive relation for the saturated shale rock can be written as 30: σ = σ0 + C : ε + αs(p0 −p)I −KεLpp + pLI(1)  where, σ is the stress tensor, Pa; ε is the strain tensor; σ0 represents the initial geo-stress tensor, Pa; C is the stiffness tensor, Pa; αs is the Biot’s coefficient. ient; p, p0 and pL are the real-time, initial and Langmuir pressure, respectively, Pa; I is the unit diagonal matrix; K is the bulk modulus of the rock, Pa; εL is the Langmuir strain constant. The force balance equation for the saturated porous rock can be expressed as 30: ∇⋅σ + ρsg = 0(2)  where, ρs is the rock density, kg/m3; g is the gravity, m/s2. Generally, the strain tensor of the rock can be calculated using the displacement of the solid phase: ε = 12(∇us + ∇Tus)(3)  where, us is the displacement vector, m. Fig. 1 illustrates the geometric model of the fractured rock. Consid­ering the fracture closure during the production process, the fracture aperture can be calculated using the rock displacement in fracture sur­faces 49, i.e., Eq. (4)： df = df0 −(u+s ⋅n+f + u−s ⋅n−f)(4)  where, df0 the initial fracture aperture; u+s and u−s are rock displace­ments in fracture surfaces, m; n+f and n−f are outer norm vectors of fracture surfaces. The plus and minus signs represent different fracture surfaces of the same fracture. 2.1.2. Gas transport mechanisms in organic-rich shale In low-permeability shale gas reservoirs, part of hydrocarbon resource exists as free gas in inorganic matter and the other part is adsorbed in organic matter as adsorption gas. The gas transport mech­anisms in organic nanopores are complex involving with surface diffu­sion, viscous flow and Knudsen diffusion under the effect of gas adsorption/desorption, whose schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 2. In this paper, when the matrix contains organic matters, there are both the organic matrix pores and inorganic matrix pores. Otherwise, there is only inorganic matrix pores. Generally, the mass conservation equation for shale gas reservoir is expressed below when the compressibility is considered 21. ∂(ρϕ)∂t+(αs −ϕ)∂εv∂t −∇⋅(ρ kapμ ∇p)= qs(5)  where, ρ is the gas density, kg/m3; ϕ is the rock porosity;αs is the Biot’s coefficient, dimensionless; εv is the volumetric strain of the rock; μ is gas viscosity, Pa⋅s; kap is the apparent permeability, m2; qs represents the source/sink term, m3/s. The gas physical properties are related with reservoir pressure and Fig. 1. The conceptual diagram of the fractured rock.  Fig. 2. Gas flow in the organic matrix pores.

Numerical method for fracture propagation After obtaining the stress and pressure distribution that are induced by parent wells, the fracture propagation in the infill well can be simulated based on the induced stress and pressure distributions. In this paper, the discontinuous discrete fracture model is proposed to describe the complex fractures of the infill well 49. As shown in Fig. 3, the stress state near the tip of the fractures (i.e., the top nodes of the fractures and the nodes connected to them) is manipulated to determine fracture propagation when simulating the fracturing process. For a single fracture, the previous top node of the fracture will be split into two fracture surface nodes when fracture propagates. The propagation path is chosen with the maximum tensile- stress criterion given by Eqs. (21)-(23) 16,34： cos θi2[KIcos2θi2 −32KII sin θi]≥KIC(21)  KI = Fy/̅̅̅̅̅̅̅2xcπ√(22)  KII = Fx/̅̅̅̅̅̅̅2xcπ√(23)  where, θi is the angle of potential propagation path, degrees; KI and KII are the first and second stress intensity factors, N/m1/2; KIC is the frac­ture toughness, N/m3/2; Fx and Fy are the total forces in the fracture tip, N; xc is the half length of fracture tip grid, m. As shown in Fig. 3, grid edges that linked with the facture tip nodes are the potential propagation paths of hydraulic fractures. After obtaining the stress field around the fracture tip, the propagation path is determined by using Eq. (21). The specific path with the minimum θi is chosen from potential paths. 3. Model validation We used two numerical cases to verify our program. Firstly, the numerical coupling of the solid deformation and fluid flow is verified through the Mandel’s problem described by typical analytical solution 1. Secondly, a single fracture propagation problem is employed to validate our program in simulating fracture propagation. The parameters for model validation are summarized in Table 1. 3.1. Validation of the solid-fluid coupling process The coupling between solid and fluid is the base of calculating the production-induced stress during production and the injection-induced stress during fracturing. Mandel’s problem is a benchmark example to test the correctness of solid-fluid coupling in our program. Fig. 4 shows the geometry model of Mandel’s problem. The length and height of the specimen are respectively 30 m and 20 m. The location of the pressure monitoring point is given in Fig. 4. An average distributed force 2 F= 2 × 106 N/m is applied to the grey rigid plate. The right boundary is subjected to the ambient pressure. Other boundaries are non- permeable. We selected the analytical solution 1 to validate the pore pressure against the simulation results in the monitoring point. The good match between the simulation result and the analytical solution shown in Fig. 5 illustrates the correctness of our solid-liquid coupling program. 3.2. Validation of the fracture propagation Our program considers the leakage from fracture into the rock ma­trix, therefore, we compare our program with a FEM based commercial software, ABAQUS, to verify the correctness of our program in simu­lating the fracture propagation. Fig. 6 shows the geometry model used in the simulation of a single fracture. The injection rate is set as 0.005 m3/ s. Comparison of simulation results of our program and ABAQUS are Fig. 8.

Therefore, the fracture aperture calculated by the ABAQUS model is smaller than our model in the early stage of fracture propagation and larger than our model in the later propagation. During the entire process of fracture propagation, the total fluid leakage is basically the same, which makes the fracture volume approximately the same. 4. Results In this section, three numerical cases considering the effect of organic matter content on infill-well hydraulic fracturing are con­structed. Fig. 8 shows the schematic diagram of shale gas reservoir including two parent wells and an infill-well region, in which the dark yellow region represents the non-infill well region (Region #1) and the bright yellow region represents the infill-well region (Region #2) on the basis of uniform distribution. The monitoring point is chosen for calculating the alteration angle of the maximum horizontal principal stresses. Table 2 lists the simulation parameters of the reservoir. 4.1. The effect of uniformly distributed organic matters on stress variation In this section, organic matters are uniformly distributed in the whole reservoir. Fig. 9 presents the distribution and the direction vari­ation of the maximum horizontal principal stresses during production. A comparison of the two graphs shows that the maximum horizontal principal stress gradually decreases as the production continues, and the area of the stress-reduction region increases as production continues. The black arrows represent the direction of the maximum horizontal principal stress. Obviously, the maximum horizontal principal stress in the infill-well region (Region #2) is almost undisturbed inside the white circular area in Fig. 9a and Fig. 9b. When production continues from 300 days to 900 days, it shows that the white circular area becomes smaller, indicating that the stress variation region in the infill-well re­gion becomes larger.

It can be seen that a significant pressure drop occurred in the fracture area of each parent well and there is no significant pressure disturbance between the two parent wells after 300 days of production. When the production time reaches 900 days, a significant pressure disturbance occurs between the two parent wells. Fig. 11 represents the increased alteration angle of the maximum horizontal principal stress versus production time at the monitoring point considering three different mass fractions of organic matter. Define the alteration angle without considering the effect of organic matters shrinkage as θ1 and the alteration angle when considering the shrinkage of organic matters as θ2, so that the increased alteration angle is θ2 −θ1. It can be seen that the increased alteration angle of the maximum horizontal principal stress increases gradually and almost reached the maximum after 1 year of production, and then decreases. Furthermore, the higher the organic matter mass fraction, the larger the increased alteration angle of maximum horizontal principal stress. The main reason is due to the gradual desorption of the adsorbed gas at the monitoring point after the production time reaches 30 days and the shrinkage of the organic matter occurs. And the higher the organic matter content, the greater the volume strain caused by organic matter shrinkage (in Fig. 12), which ultimately leads to a greater degree of local stress field variation and a larger alteration angle.

However, the effects of organic matter content in organic-rich shale on stress interference have not been well considered during developing infill-wells. A fully coupled numerical model is proposed in this paper to consider the whole flow spectrum of shale gas and investigate the effect of organic matter content on stress variation and fracture propagation in infill-well. Through simulating the production and fracturing process with only one set of code, some conclusions can be drawn that the alteration angle of the maximum horizontal principal stress increases and then decreases with the production time. Furthermore, the shrinkage of organic matter enlarges the alteration angle and the magnitude of the maximum horizontal principal stress. Certainly, the optimal fracturing effect in the infill-wells vary due to the different mass fraction of organic matter. This study not only helps to understand the effect of mass fraction of organic matter on stress variation and fracture propagation, but also provides theoretical support for increasing production from shale gas reservoirs.   1. Introduction Infill-well development is an essential way to effectively extract hydrocarbon from shale gas reservoirs. Certainly, hydraulic fracturing of the infill-wells is crucial for the production enhancement 29,35,50. However, it is also a very challenging task in shale gas reservoirs. The first one is that the organic matter contained in the shale formation has a large impact on the fracturing effect of the infill wells. The second one is that the production of the parent wells will lead to continuous changes in formation stress for well zones with many parent wells, which will affect the fracture propagation after the infill wells are fractured, and conversely the changes in formation pressure due to fracturing of the infill wells will affect the production of the parent wells. As for the influence of the organic matter contained in the shale formation on the fracturing effect, since the shale gas is mainly stored in formations as free and adsorbed gas, and the adsorbed gas is mainly adsorbed in the organic matter of the shale formation. When the free gas is continuously extracted, the adsorbed gas starts to desorb thereby causing the shrinkage of the organic matter. Complex flows including viscous flow, transition flow, sloshing, surface diffusion and Knudsen diffusion, etc. will occur in shale gas reservoirs (15,36,37,40,43). In the majority of cases, the distribution of organic matter in the shale is uni­form, but different mass fraction of organic matter can affect the deformation caused by desorption 10. However, previous studies have rarely considered the effect of different mass fraction of organic matter on the mechanical properties of shale. As for the condition that the production-induced stress in parent wells have a significant impact on the fracture propagation in infill-wells 7,20, the integrated numerical simulation method is an important tech­nical support for the hydraulic fracturing of shale gas formations, in which the numerical simulation technology of fracture propagation has been relatively mature 2,41,44,51,54. Nowadays, the numerical methods of fracture propagation include extended finite element method (XFEM, 4), displacement discontinuity method (DDM, 21), boundary element method (BEM, 12) and discrete element method (DEM, 52) have been commonly used. Camacho and Ortiz 8 proposed a Lagrangian finite element method of fracture propagation to study the impact damage problem in brittle materials. Weng et al., 46 proposed an unconventional fracture model (UFM) to simulate 3D fracture propagation in a naturally fractured reservoir. In essence, the integrated numerical simulation technology takes the simulation results (pressure and stress field) in one process as the initial state of another process, i.e., the continuous process * Corresponding author.

Al Qabany et al.1,2using different concentrations of CS for sand column curing tests, found that a low concentration of CS was more favorable for the uniform distribution of CaCO3 crystals inside the cured sand. When the con­centration of CS is too high (>1.0 M), the reaction between binder and bacteria is fast and the activity of bacteria is inhibited (bacteria are concentrated in the surface layer and their activity decreases), which results in the production of large-sized and unevenly distributed calcium carbonate (the calcium carbonate is also concentrated in the upper end of the column), This is ineffective for the bonding of particles, and the large-sized calcium carbonate accumulates on the surface of the column is prone to block the pore space of the upper end of the column1,2 (pore space of sand column). In contrast, the accumulation of large amounts of calcium carbonate on the surface of the sand column tends to clog the pores at the upper end of the sand column 1, which reduces the permeability of the soil and prevents the infiltration of the subsequent solution. This results in a better modification of the calcium carbonate in the surface layer, whereas a low structural strength (i.e., poor integrity) within the soil restricts the depth of the modification of the MICP. The results of our study, that is, the evaluation of the structural integrity of sandy soils with three combinations of BS and CS concen­trations (Figs. 7a2–7a4), also visually corroborate this phenomenon. The ability to maintain structural integrity (i.e., upright retention (Fig. 7b) and resistance to scouring and soaking (Figs. 7d and 7e)) is a key indicator for assessing the tightness of sand grains. The results of the upright retention test (Fig. 7b) mainly (qualitatively) explored the ability to maintain structural integrity (upright state) under four treat­ment regimens (different combinations of BS and CS pairings), that is, Regimen 1: Deionized water was injected only and no BS or CS was injected (blank control group, specimens #7, #12, (yellow wireframe in Fig. 7b)); Regimen 2: Injection of CS only and no BS specimens #8, #11, (blue wireframe in Fig. 7b)); Regimen 3: Injection of BS only, without CS (specimens #9, #10, (green wireframe in Fig. 7b)); Regimen 4: BS and CS were injected (specimens #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6) (the BS and CS concentration pairings of the six specimens were not consistent). As shown in Fig. 7b, although all sand specimens (specimens #1-#12 were sea sand) (Details provided in Table S2 of Note 4 in SI) showed an intact upright morphology in the initial state (Fig. 7b (1)), the bond between the sand particles weakened with time, that is, there were significant differences in the ability of the sand particles to maintain the structural integrity (upright state) after 10 d of exposure to the same external environment (drying method: air-drying, temperature: 25 ℃) (Fig. 7b (2)). Specifically, (i) blank control group sand specimens were injected with deionized water (i.e., BS = OD600 = 0.0; CS = 0.0 M) and were unable to maintain their integrity (e.g., Specimen #7 in Fig. 7b (1), where the specimen could not stand upright at the beginning of the test), Fig. 7.

(ii) Similar to the blank control group sand specimens, the specimens treated with CS alone (i.e., BS =0.0; CS=0.5,1.0 M) could barely stood upright in the early part of the test and failed to maintain their integrity in the later part of the test (Specimens #8 (BS=0.0; CS=0.5 M) and #11 (BS=0.0; CS=1.0 M)) (Fig. 7b (2)). (iii) The specimens treated with BS alone (BS=0.5, 1.0; CS=0.0 M) retained only discontinuous chunks (Specimens #9 (BS=0.5; CS=0.0 M) and #10 (BS=1.0; CS=0.0 M)) (Fig. 7b (2)). (iv) Sand specimens treated with BS and CS (BS =0.5, 1.0, 1.5; CS=0.5, 1.0,1.5 M) maintained their intact morphology (Specimen #1 (BS=0.5; CS=0.5 M), Specimen #3 (BS=1.0; CS=0.5 M), Specimen #4 (BS=1.0; CS= 1.0 M), Specimen #5 (BS=1.0; CS=1.5 M), and Specimen #6 (BS=1.5; CS=0.5 M)), except for the individual specimens treated with high concentrations of BS, CS that showed partial disintegration and sporadic scattering phenomena (Specimen #2 (BS=2.0; CS=2.0 M)) (Fig. 7b (2)). Based on the qualitative results of the aforementioned upright retention test, the results of the sand specimens under the four treatment regimens showed large differences. We found that the blank control group (i) (not treated with MICP) and the sand specimens treated with CS alone (ii), because the adhesion between the internal sand grains usually consists of matrix suction (i.e., apparent cohesion) 56, they also retained a short period of time in the pre-test upright form. Despite employing two single-phase liquid treatments of sand specimens (i.e., CS (ii) and BS (iii) alone, respectively), the structural integrity of sand specimens in (ii) versus (iii) varied significantly (i.e., specimens #8, #11 compared to specimens #9, #10) due to the fact that, compared to the non-adhesive liquid properties of CS in (ii), (iii) the adhesive properties of bacteria (more precisely biofilms) play an active role in maintaining the structural integrity of the sand specimens 29. The sand specimen (iv) after the combined action of BS,CS and the sand specimen (iii) treated with BS alone showed a longer period of upright retention mainly because the adhesion between sand grains was provided by biofilm or calcium carbonate precipitation (i.e., true cohesion) 24,56. However, a single biofilm was efficacious for the improvement of the sand specimen, whereas a combination of a biofilm and a mineralized precipitation comprise a composite barrier that has a more positive effect on the cementing seal 28,78. The four treatment options demonstrated in the upright retention test can be visualized qualitatively and found that: 1) the untreated sand could not consistently maintain its integrity; 2) when only CS was injected into the sand specimens, the gelling effect demonstrated was essentially the same as that of the untreated sand specimens; 3) when only BS was injected into the treated sand specimens, the biofilm action made the sand specimens have a gelling effect, but it was not intense; and 4) the combined action of the BS and the CS (i.e., biofilm and mineralized precipitation composition of the composite barrier) under the nature of sand specimens can be greatly improved. In this subsec­tion, the differences between the four treatment options are qualita­tively analyzed. Specific quantitative comparative analysis is provided in the subsequent subsections. In addition, the underlying intrinsic causes of the above-mentioned macroscopic phenomena were fully revealed by a visual comparison of the cross-sections of sand specimens (sea sand) (Details are provided in Table S2 of Note 4 in the SI) before (blank control) and after (containing mineralization information) MICP treatment. The particles in the sand specimens untreated by MICP were loosely packed, as shown on the left side of Fig. 7c, indicating that there was no cementation or bonding among the particles and that the pores between the particles were not filled. In contrast, the particles in the sand specimens treated by MICP (Fig. 7c, right side) were held firmly together by the mineral crystals that formed a coating on the particles (white crystals “after treatment”) and directly filled the pores. The ability to maintain structural integrity when encountering water is another indicator of the presence of bio­cementation in the sand specimens. The corresponding tests included scouring (river sand) (Fig. 7d) and soaking (quartz sand) (Fig. 7e) (De­tails in Table S2 in Note 4 of SI and videos S1–S3). As shown in Fig. 7d, the sand specimens untreated by MICP resisted scouring for only 12 s. In contrast, the sand specimens treated by MICP remained upright and exhibited no particle scattering phenomenon after continuous scouring for 3.5 h. Similar trends were observed in the soaking tests; the sand specimens untreated by MICP only adhered for 43 s prior to collapse (Fig. 7e3). In contrast, the sand specimens treated with MICP did not exhibit any signs of disintegration after soaking for 2.5 h and remained in a nearly primitive state (Fig. 7e5). In summary, the aforementioned test results prove the existence of biocementation in the sand specimens treated with MICP. 3.2. Hydraulic characteristics of the biocemented sand The porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the sand specimens before and after MICP treatment, obtained from the test methods described in Sections 2.4.1 and 2.4.2, are shown in Fig. 8 and Table 5. As shown in Fig. 8, both the porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the sand specimens after MICP treatment (Part II in Fig. 8) exhibited a downward trend when compared to those of the untreated specimens (Part I in Fig. 8), indicating that the sand specimens treated by MICP under various schemes (an orthogonal scheme of three types of sand at five levels of treatment liquid concentration level combination; Table 5, and S2 in Note 4 of SI) were effective in reducing both the porosity and hydraulic conductivity, which was beneficial for controlling the internal erosion caused by seepage. The measured findings in Table 5 further reveal an average decrease of 5.5% and 97.2%, in the porosity and hy­draulic conductivity, respectively, from 0.382 and 4.33 × 10-4 m/s for the control specimens to 0.361 and 1.2 × 10-5 m/s for the treated specimens. It is evident that the hydraulic conductivity of the treated sand specimens was significantly reduced (the maximum reduction amplitude was as high as two orders of magnitude; details are provided in Table 5), even though the porosity of these sands was only 1–3% lower than that of the control specimens. Thus, the impermeability of sand was significantly affected by MICP. The change in the BS concen­tration was considered as a factor. With the BS, the total flow conduc­tivity of the specimen (B-E group, excluding B1, C1, D1, and E1, and the four 0 concentration cement control groups) first decreased and then increased, with a low trend in the C region of Part II. Secondly, based on the change trend in each small area of Part II (the change in CS con­centration in five groups of B, C, D, and E), the internal changes in the five groups first decreased and then increased; that is, the corresponding CS concentration was 0.5 mol/L. The value of C2 is the most optimal in Part II (the minimum value is 1.238 ×10−6 m/s), which means that once the concentration of treatment fluid exceeds a certain value (e.g., con­centration of CS exceeds 0.5 M or the concentration of BS exceeds 1), the impermeability of biocemented sand begins to deteriorate. Therefore, it was confirmed that applying unequal treatment conditions to sand resulted in varying biocementation levels and effects, with C2 (OD600 =1, BS =0.5 M) showing the optimal results (i.e., the best impermeability). In addition, comparing the left and right sides of Fig. 8, the shift trends of the water-conducting performance and pore quantification indicators of the biocemented sand did not always match significantly. That is, the hydraulic conductivity of biocemented sand with low porosity is not necessarily low, and as shown in Table 5, the hydraulic conductivity of those with high porosity may also be low; some scholars have obtained similar research results 72. The porosity of river sand-B5 is at the lowest level (34.92%) but not with the lowest hydraulic con­ductivity (6.550 ×10-6 m/s, more remarkable than others), which is 81.10% greater than the hydraulic conductivity of C2 (1.238 ×10-6 m/s). Although the porosity of quartz sand-C2 (35.14%) was not the lowest, its hydraulic conductivity was lowest (1.238 ×10-6 m/s). Our results showed that if the quantification was based on the type of sand (whether it is sea sand (sub-rounded), river sand (sub-angular), and L.

That is, (1) porosity and hydraulic conductivity basically show a positive correla­tion; (2) In the two points B5 and C2, (two special points), i.e., the specimen with the smallest porosity does not necessarily have the smallest hydraulic conductivity (specimen B5), and the specimen with the smallest hydraulic conductivity does not necessarily have the lowest porosity (specimen C2) (this is somewhat different from the viewpoint that we generally believe that ""samples with small porosity also have smaller hydraulic conductivity""); (3) with the changes in the concen­tration of the treatment solution, the three types of sand specimens in the concentration of BS = 1,CS = 0.5, are shown as having the best hydraulic conductivity decline; (4) from quantitative BS and variable CS, it can be found that the porosity and permeability of the three types of sand. The porosity and hydraulic conductivity of the sand in general show a decreasing trend first, and then increasing trend. However, at BS= 0.5, the porosity shows a decreasing trend, followed by increasing and then decreasing trends, and at BS= 2, the hydraulic conductivity shows a decreasing trend, followed by increasing and then decreasing trends; (5) When the quantitative value is CS, and the variable is BS, it can be found that the hydraulic conductivity shows a lower value at CS= 1; (6) In the case of single liquid injection, i.e., BS only or CS only, it was found that BS only was more effective than CS only (the same result was obtained in Section 3.1-Maintaining Integrity). If the quantification was based on the concentration of the treatment solution and the variable was the shape of the sand, (1) The porosity of sea sand (sub-rounded) was always the highest for the same treatment solution concentration pairing, compared to river sand (sub-angular), and quartz sand (angular); and (2) At a treatment solution concentration of C2 (BS = 1, CS = 0.5), the magnitude of change was greater for quartz sand (angular) than that for the other two. Therefore, two conclusions can be drawn: (1) the most significant decrease in permeability was observed when the concentration of the treatment solution was paired with (BS=1,CS=0.5); (2) the biological treatment effect was better than that of river sand (sub-angular) and sea sand (sub-rounded) when the sand was quartz sand (angular), whereas when the sand was sea sand (sub-rounded), the hydraulic properties were poorly improved (the poorer the roundness, the better the improvement in hydraulic properties). We analyzed that the main reasons for such a result are: (1) the concentration of treatment solution and the roundness of sand will regulate the biocementation pattern, which will change the internal pore structure of the sand body; (2) effective biocementation calcium carbonate precipitation will block the key pore channels, so that the dominant seepage channels are blocked, which makes the hydraulic conductivity plummet, Based on our inference, the preferential flow caused by the heterogeneous distribution of mineral precipitation in biocemented sand was believed to be the origin of this phenomenon. Some scholars have also found a similar phenomenon, that is, the vari­ation of the permeability versus CaCO3 content depends on the pore- scale CaCO3 distributions which modify the structure and the pattern of the pore fluid channel 2,5,54; and (3) the biofilm alone also has a certain effect of modification. 3.3. Cementation patterns and area filling rate We employed an image stacking method to enhance the clarity of the obtained microscopic images. The resulting stack-processed images were digitized to extract internal structure information (Fig. 9). In accordance with the identification findings, we observed three typical cementation patterns in biocemented sand: the multi-particle encapsu­lation and bridging type (referred to as G-C-G), locally coated particle coated type (referred to as G-C), and sporadically filled interparticle pore type (i.e., locally cemented interparticle contact points, referred to as G-G). Based on the analysis of a microscope slice of the biocemented sand, Fig. 9 shows the results of extracting the pore-filling ratios for the identified cementation patterns. The corresponding parameters are lis­ted in Table 6. The microscopic imaging data reveals that the pore filling ratios of G-C-G, G-G, and G-C were 81.2%, 19.7% and 11.7%, respectively. Based on the analysis of pore-filling ratios, it can be observed that the G-C-G pattern exhibits the most effective cementation with a pore filling ratio of 81.2%, indicating a high degree of pore sealing and water blocking rate of 68.5%. However, the G-C pattern shows a relatively low pore filling ratio of 11.7% and a low effective sealing rate of 2.4%, suggesting that internal CaCO3 plays a minor role in pore filling and does not contribute significantly to the cementation. Notably, the distribution of the different cementation patterns varied among the biocemented sand specimens under different MICP treatment schemes. In specimens with a BS concentration of 0 or a CS concentra­tion of 0 (i.e., river sand, sea sand, and quartz sand corresponding to their respective A1-A5, B1, C1, D1, E1, etc.), no CaCO3 was found, resulting in the absence of the corresponding cementation patterns. However, in the experimental group with the joint participation of BS and CS, three cementation patterns (G-C-G, G-G, and G-C) were observed, but their proportions differed. In specimens with poor hy­draulic characteristics (large porosity and hydraulic conductivity) (i.e., specimens B2, C5, E4 of river, sea, and quartz sands, respectively, and specimen D4 of sea sand), the dominant pattern was G-C, accounting for approximately 75–80%, followed by G-G at 10–15%, and G-C-G at 5–10%. This is because the interior of these specimens was predomi­nantly governed by the G-C cementation pattern, and the occurrence of the G-C-G cementation pattern was relatively limited, resulting in a poor seepage retardation effect. However, in specimens with better hydraulic Fig. 8. Hydraulic characteristics of sand specimens before and after MICP treatment under various schemes. Left: Porosity; right: Hydraulic conductivity.

Influence of sand particle morphology on biomineralization From the results obtained in the previous section (results of hydraulic properties in subsection 3.2, and results of cementation pattern in Subsection 3.3), it can be observed that: (1) Compared with river sand (sub-angular) and quartz sand (angular), at the same concentration of treatment solution, the porosity of sea sand (sub-rounded) (Fig. 8, left) was the highest. (2) the magnitude of change in hydraulic conductivity of quartz sand (angular) is larger than that of the other two at treatment solution concentration of C2 (BS = 1, CS = 0.5) (Fig. 8, right); and (3) the G-C cementation pattern dominates inside the sea sand specimen, G -G pattern dominates inside the river sand specimen, and G-C-G pattern dominates in quartz sand. The physical properties of the three sands varied, and their bio-cementation effects were also different. It can be observed that the three types of sand (sea sand (sub- rounded), river sand (sub-angular), quartz sand (angular)) with different morphologies (i.e., different roundness) may have different effects on the mineralization and cementation effect of the biocementation sand. Therefore, the roundness (i.e., sub-rounded, sub-angular, and angular) of three different types of sands (i.e., sea, river, and quartz sands) were selected for this study under the condition that other factors were controlled to be as similar as possible (it is to be noted that because the different roundness of the same kind of sand is not easy to obtain, and because the main chemical elements of the three types of sands (i.e., sea, river, and quartz sands) are dominated by silica), the roundness of the three different types of sands (i.e., sea, river, and quartz sands) were selected for this study (i.e., sub-rounded, sub- angular, and angular) were selected for this study, and microfluidic tests on the effect of sand particle morphology on biomineralization were conducted out based on a Y-pipe; the results are shown in Fig. 10. The full field of view of the Y-shaped microfluidic test is shown in Fig. 10 (a(i)); one branch of which is the injection tube for the bacterial suspension (Fig. 10 (a(ii)) and the other is the injection tube for the curing liquid (Fig. 10(a (iii)); and the direction of injection of both is shown in Fig. 10 (a(iv); and the reaction end of the two-phase liquids is shown in Fig. 10 (a(v)). The three types of sand particles were uniformly placed in different microfluidic pipelines, and the more typical test di­agrams of each of the river, quartz and sea sands were selected along the microfluidic pipelines (Fig. 10 (b),(c),(d),(e) and (f)). In the test river sand (sub-angular) particles (Fig. 10(b) and (f)), heterogeneous miner­alization (non-uniform mineralization) occurs mostly in the shortest distance between the particles at the corners, and the directional mineralization is particularly significant when the corners of multiple particles are facing each other (Fig. 10b (iv and)), and the growth of the G-G pattern is clearly seen (Fig. 10f (i-vi)); in contrast, the growth of the quartz sand (angular) particles (Fig. 10f (i-vi)) is more evident than the growth of the quartz sand (Fig. 10f (i-vi)). In contrast, quartz sand (angular) particles (Fig. 10 (c) and (e)) were more angular (less rounded), with more pronounced heterogeneous mineralization (Fig. 10c (i)), and the phenomenon of bridging growth (effective pre­cipitation) into G-C-G pattern was clearly seen (Fig. 10e (i-vi)); on the contrary, the sea sand particles (Fig. 10d), which were observed to be rounded before the test, were not angular, and 360◦of all the particles were mineralized. On the contrary, the sea sand particles (Fig. 10d), which were observed to be rounded and angular before the test, were uniformly surrounded by mineralized precipitates at 360◦and grew into ineffective calcium carbonate precipitates. Supplementary material related to this article can be found online at doi:10.1016/j.gete.2023.100519. In this section, the irregular polygonal shape (poor roundness) of the quartz sand (angular) facilitates the adsorption and retention of bacteria on the surface of the sand particles (acting as nucleation sites), which efficiently induces the gradual accumulation of mineralized precipitates along the direction of the dominant growth of the crystals (Fig. 10 (e) Table 6 Data extraction from cementation patterns found in 2D microscope slices.  2D microscopic image  Pore (um2) Total CaCO3 (um2) Effective CaCO3 (um2) Pore filling ratio (%) Effective CaCO3 (%) Pore filling error (%) Precipitation error (%)  UC 892,449.7 0.0 0.0  0.0  0.0  0.000  0.000 G-C- G 1322,752.7 1567,827.0 1073,499.0  81.2  68.5  5.933  4.666 G- G 318,735.5 1927,689.9 62,869.8  19.7  3.3  3.024  2.016 G-C 497,064.5 2461,031.0 58,026.6  11.7  2.4  5.305  4.003  Fig. 10.

In contrast, sea sand is less angular (more rounded), and it is difficult for the bacteria carried by BS to proliferate and metabolize at a specific location. It is also difficult for the flocs to form strong and irreversible agglomerates, which can effectively connect the sand grains or fill the intergranular pore spaces, thus contributing to the adsorption of bacteria and the bridging of crystals to a low degree. The cementing effect of river sand was inter­mediate between those of sea sand and quartz sand.  1. Precipitation pattern of calcium carbonate (effective, ineffective) and biofilm retention The results of this study are similar to those of Song et al. 85, where sub-rounded particles accumulated a greater mass of calcium carbonate on the particle surface than (sub-angular) particles and angular parti­cles; however, the angular particles showed the greatest decrease in permeability for the same treatment time (similar to the results of the experiments in this study, which are outlined by C2 in Fig. 8), suggesting that the microscopic distribution of calcium carbonate is significantly affected by the particle morphology and that it plays a significant role in the clogging effect. The results of hydraulic conductivity change suggest that the microscopic distribution of calcium carbonate is significantly affected by particle morphology, which plays a key role in controlling the plugging effect. SEM images (Fig. 11 (a)) show that microbial cal­cium carbonate precipitates wrapped the spherical particles into a nearly homogeneous shell (similar to the results from the experiments in this study, the results in Fig. 10 (d)), and closed the pore space by increasing the thickness of the shell only. In contrast, the sub-rounded (Fig. 10 (a)) and angular (Fig. 10 (a)) particles were only partially covered by a calcium carbonate film (similar to the results of the ex­periments herein, as shown in Fig. 10 (e) and (f)). As microorganisms and calcite continued to accumulate on the surface of the particles, the pore structure was effectively altered (sealing off key locations such as pore throats) (similar to the results of the tests herein, results in Fig. 10 (e) and (f)), leading to a hydraulic conductivity that could be signifi­cantly reduced even at lower calcium carbonate levels (similar to the results of the tests here in, Fig. 8 the hydraulic conductivity point C2 results, i.e., porosity is not the lowest, but the hydraulic conductivity is the lowest). Konstantinou et al., 50 Evaluating the effect of particle shape, size and particle size distribution on permeability and porosity, it was found that better strength enhancement and more controllable permeability reduction could be achieved for bioprocessed specimens with moderate number of particle-to-particle contacts (Dso=180–890 µm). Particle size is only one of the grain characteristics that affects the engineering properties achievable in bioprocessed specimens 51, and even in the absence of a binder, the grain shape and particle size distribution (PSD) affects strength. Compared to spherical particles, angular particles can form a more open and less dense struc­ture with a smaller number of contact points between particles; therefore, a smaller number of particle-to-particle contacts, which are effective locations for cementation to occur 45. This difference has also been reported to be related to the distribu­tion of bacteria on the particle surfaces 98,99. Regarding bacterial (bio­film) adsorption in microfluidic channels, bacteria prefer to stay at the intersecting sites of particles that are angular (poorly rounded) and have a heterogeneous (irregular) morphology; therefore, thery are more conducive to the formation and expansion of the biofilm system, thereby facilitating the formation and accumulation of biomineralized pre­cipitates 18,4,42. Therefore, the retention effect of sea sand (sub-rounded) was slightly worse than that of river sand (sub-angular) and quartz sand (angular), and the flocs (i.e., mineralized precipitation + biofilm) could not be efficiently retained between sand grains. Therefore, the bacteria could not be localized to perform expansion and metabolism, and the biofilm could not play the role of water-blocking and anti-shearing, that is, it was unable to form a strong and irreversible group.  2. Blockage of preferential flow paths Combined with the point C2 analysis of the difference in hydraulic properties in Subsection 3.2 (Fig. 8), the result leading to ’the lowest hydraulic conductivity but not the lowest porosity’ may be related to the bridging effect of the effective precipitation. That is, the generation of the G-C-G, G-G pattern blocking the critical pore throat site (Fig. 10(e), (f)), which makes the flow paths gradually become more tortuous (Fig. 4 (c) and (d)), leading to a significant decrease in permeability. In addi­tion, biofilms play an important role in sealing and impermeability and have been shown to be effective in reducing free pore volume and sealing flow pathways, forming a barrier that reduces the flow of fluids through porous media. Irregular particle morphology results in a more favorable biofilm formation capacity, which has been confirmed in most experimental studies 35,59,81. This is because the flow path of bacterial suspensions between irregular particles (as opposed to particle shapes) is more tortuous than that of regular particles and may drag near sur­faces, reducing the advection velocity, resulting in isolated bacteria colonizing other surfaces to form more biofilms, which then fill the pore space and bridge the particles (similar to the results in Fig. 10 (e),(f) from the experiments conducted in this study) and maintain a stable sedimentation (effective cementation) and ultimately reduce the permeability of the hydraulic barrier continuously 2. It can be noted that the morphology of sand particles has a significant effect on the bacterial adsorption, retention and even the construction of biofilm system involved in biomineralization. The results of this study showed that the worse the roundness of the particles, the more adequate the bacterial adsorption and retention, and the better the biominerali­zation effect. Quartz sand (angular) in this test is the most suitable for the growth of bacteria, and has the best relative effect on biomineralization. Fig. 11.

Influence of reaction solution on biocementation Previous section on MICP-improved soils has focused on laboratory column experiments that examined spatial variations in the porosity and permeability of MICP-treated sand columns, and field experiments that observed the evolution of MICP-treated sands, sealing layers to reduce permeability, and the extent of the impact. However, these experiments require several days and are subject to uncertain environmental factors in the field, and the porosity of the prepared sand columns is inconsistent with the concentration errors that occur between batches of the slurry 101,66,94,96. Numerical methods are dominant and provide trend results at a low time cost, enabling different injection methods and multiple inlets to be set at varying depths for testing. Biofilms are generally considered to be heterogeneous matrices composed of microbial communities with extracellular polymers (EPS, microbial cell metabolites), which are formed in natural environments and engineered systems by microbial attachment and growth. They are mainly used to stabilize spatial organization by providing intercellular Fig. 12. Cloud chart of the simulation results of the interaction between biofilm and CaCO3.

Biofilms may also induce significant effects in the hydro­dynamics of porous media owing to the irregular properties of their structures. A comparison of the results of sand porosity and hydraulic conductivity tests before and after biocementation revealed that the overall decreases in porosity and hydraulic conductivity of sands injected with CS only (e.g., groups A2, A3, A4, and A5) and sands injected with BS only (e.g., groups B1, C1, D1, and E1) and cultured continuously under suitable conditions were very different (weak in the former and significant in the latter), although overall decreases in porosity and hydraulic conductivity were observed in both cases. Considering the nutrients provided by the latter test to maintain microbial growth and the culture environment suitable for microbial community proliferation and biofilm system construction 21, it is hypothesized that the microbial cells and their biofilm system, constructed together with EPS, play a positive role as hydraulic barriers in the seepage resistance of porous media and have the potential to enhance microbial mineralization to a certain extent 57. To this end, the extent of the contribution of the bio­film and mineralization precipitation to the reduction in porosity and permeability (impermeability performance) of the biocemented sand was further explored through simulation analysis. Based on the differ­ences in the indoor permeability test and porosity measurement exper­iment described in Section 3.2, that is, in the case of only the injection of BS only (i.e., B1, C1, D1, and E1 sand specimens) or the injection of CS only (i.e., A2, A3, A4, and A5 sand specimens), the hydraulic conductivity and porosity improved (the improvement effect of the injection of CS only was not evident). Biofilms are generally believed to be heteroge­neous matrices composed of a microbial community and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS, microbial cell metabolites), which are formed by the attachment and growth of microorganisms in natural environments and engineering systems. It is mainly used to provide a stable space for intercellular scaffolds formed by EPS 59. It organizes and is therefore crucial for stabilizing sediments 12. Owing to their irregular structural properties, biofilms can also significantly affect the fluid dy­namics of porous media. To further explore the intrinsic mechanism, we conducted a pre­liminary investigation of the role of biofilm and calcium carbonate precipitation, which was simulated using the DuMux software. In this study, a 3 cm × 11 cm (model length: 11 cm, width: 3 cm) sand column (Fig. 12) was investigated numerically and the evolution of biofilms, CaCO3, porosity, and permeability in the soil pores were obtained. Based on previous studies 31, this study considered uniform and fully saturated sand, which can capture the evolutionary trend of MICP and provide biofilm results. For the biomineralization part of the model 49, the in­jection flow rate and the concentrations of the nutrient solution and cement solution were determined according to the initial, boundary, and environmental conditions listed in Table 7. Based on the simulation results of the biofilm (Fig. 12(a)) and the combination of the biofilm and CaCO3 (Fig. 12(b)), the sealing process and results (i.e., the production of biofilm and calcium carbonate, also known as the volume fraction) were unevenly distributed vertically and horizontally, and the sealing was incomplete. The sealing on the left side of the sand specimens was significantly stronger than that on the right side. Specifically, under the action of the biofilm alone (i.e., the maximum volume fraction increased by nearly 32 times, from 2.2 ×10-3 at the beginning of 2 h to 7.2 ×10-2 at 8 h), the hydraulic conductivity of the sand specimen showed that the hydraulic conductivity on the left side decreased first compared to that on the right side, and the right side was barely sealed. Before 4 h, the sand specimen near the entrance (top) was significantly blocked, and after 4 h, it gradually sealed. Before 4 h, the decline in the hydraulic conductivity spread from top to bottom, and after 4 h, the hydraulic conductivity of large areas decreased by two orders of magnitude. The porosity of sand specimens showed that the minimum porosity decreased from 40% at 2 h to 32% at 8 h, which decreased by 8%. The uneven flow caused the solution to migrate along the left side of the sand specimen, and biofilm and CaCO3 appeared on the left side. After sealing the left side, the flow gradually shifted to the right side. However, combined forms of biofilms and CaCO3 have been reviewed. Over time, the coverage of the biofilm and CaCO3 increased rapidly, and the biofilm and CaCO3 expanded rapidly from the entrance (top) to the bottom and to the right, gradually filling sand specimen pores and sealing flow channels with an increase in production. Most pores are filled with biofilms, which play a major role in the sealing process. Only biofilms can achieve a large-area sealing. The sealing ef­fect and range of the biofilm group were approximately 1/7 less than those of the cement injection group, and the total CaCO3 production was approximately 1/7 that of the biofilm. CaCO3 can supplement the spatial heterogeneity of biofilm sealing, and CaCO3 generated the correspond­ing biofilm withering. With an increase in time to 6 h, a large amount of CaCO3 was generated near the entrance, and the biofilm gradually decreased, which corresponded to the decline of the biofilm. Compared to the no-CS group, the sealing effect was slightly stronger and continued to increase. The central specimen corresponded to the axis of the sand specimen, and slices 1–4 corresponded to the four cross sections that divided the sand specimen into five equal parts. From the statistical data (Fig. 13) of the simulation results, we found that: (1) Central axis: the MICP process along the central axis is not uniform, but it does not gradually decrease as in previous experiments, which corresponds to the dominant flow in the sand specimen; at the entrance and below, where most of the mineralization is evident but approximately 2 cm weak, the dominant flow may make the MICP bypass part of the sand specimen; with the increase in time, the biofilm increased the most in 4–6 h and CaCO3 was also produced in a large number of cement groups. After 6–8 h, biofilm proliferation gradually slowed, although CaCO3 was still produced in large quantities, which may be because biofilm growth was inhibited by the MICP process; biofilms play a major role in sealing and seepage control. (2) Slice 1: In Section 1, the biofilm on the left side of the sand specimen began to proliferate in large quantities after 2 h, which may have been derived from the dominant flow. The biofilm growth trend slowed or even decreased after 6 h, which may be due to inhibition of the MICP process. The biofilm with the cement group decreased more, Table 7 Boundary conditions and initial conditions for the simulation in this study.

The sealing effect in the group with CS increased slightly, and the increase in CaCO3 supplemented the sealing effect of withered cells. There was practically no MICP on the right side of Section 1, and the sealing effect on the extreme left side of the section was stronger than that on the central axis, which was related to the dominant flow. (3) Slice 2: In Section 2, the range of MICP increased and expanded to the right side compared to Section 1; however, the overall trend was similar to that of Section 1, and the range of biofilm withering spread to the right side, although this did not occur. 4. Conclusions In this study, we explored the application of MICP to enhance loose sandy soils. The hydraulic characteristics of the MICP-treated sand, and the microstructure contributing to sealing, were assessed through a se­ries of laboratory experiments, including permeability tests, porosity tests, scouring and soaking resistance tests, microstructural analysis, and microfluidic chip tests. These experiments verified the positive impact of the biofilm and CaCO3 barriers on flow channel sealing. The key con­clusions are as follows:  (1) The MICP-treated sand demonstrated biocement wrapping and bonding with loose particles. Structural integrity deteriorated at higher CS concentrations, with retained stable blocks categorized as intact, discontinuous, and loose, measuring 10, 4, and 2 cm, respectively, at CS concentrations of 0.5, 1.5, and 2.0 M.  (2) Microstructural analysis revealed three types of cementation patterns (G-C-G, G-G, and G-C) in the sands treated by microbial mineralization, as depicted in Fig. 14. The G-C-G pattern domi­nates in quartz sand (angular), the G-C pattern prevails in river sand (sub-angular), and the G-G pattern is prominent in sea sand (G-G pattern in sub-rounded). The sand body of G-C-G pattern exhibits the highest pore filling rate and the most effective overall cementation, while the sand body of the G-C pattern has the lowest pore filling rate and the least effective overall cementa­tion. The sand body of the G-G pattern features a pore filling rate between the two, with an overall cementation effect falling in the middle. Fig. 13.

The precipitation pattern is another factor that significantly influences the target application of biocementation in the field because it influences the flow properties of porous media. This may lead to treatment heterogeneity by shaping the preferential flow path according to the size, shape, and structure of the pore throats affected by the accumulation of calcite crystals 1,104,22,88, gradually changing the porosity and flow path or hydraulic conductivity of a fluid in bio­cemented materials 107,108,51,61,79. The MICP process has been studied extensively in geotechnical engineering and materials science applica­tions 27,28,44,69. In general, during MICP treatment, increasing the calcium carbonate content (CCC) in a permeable medium (e.g., sandy soil) reduces permeability 65. However, the efficiency of MICP for sealing and permeability reduction depends not only on the macroscopic magnitude of CCC but also on the precipitation position of CaCO3 in the micro pore structure 1,54,60. This also means that the trends in the hydraulic con­ductivity and porosity index of biocemented sand do not always match significantly, that is, the hydraulic conductivity of biocemented sand with low porosity is not necessarily low, and the hydraulic conductivity of biocemented sand with high porosity may also be low 72. The internal particles and intergranular pores of the uncemented sand column are evenly distributed, and the pore connections are rela­tively smooth. The fluid is often ’piston’ planar in its interior, hence the pressure change on the flow path is weak and uniform 58,59. Once the microbial mineralization product (CaCO3) is induced to deposit and gradually accumulate around the particles, the particles are wrapped and gradually bridged into blocks, the intergranular pores are naturally filled and occupied, the connectivity of the pore network is gradually weakened, the pores are gradually isolated, and the pore coordination number is gradually reduced. That is, the porosity is reduced, which causes the water flow in the body to be blocked (i.e. the hydraulic conductivity is reduced) and the direction is changed 5. DeJong et al. 28 reported that in the case of bio-mineralization, the CaCO3 precipitates that form at particle-particle contacts are the most important (elevated effective stress to enhance mechanical strength, blocking of dominant seepage paths to reduce permeability), whereas those formed in solution or on exposed particle surfaces do not contribute significantly to changes in permeability, which is also true for microbial biofilms in solutions and on particle surfaces 15,30,64,77. Consequently, even though the total amounts of CaCO3 may be equal, the size, morphology, and microscopic characteristics may differ when applied to various microenvironmental conditions (e.g., soil properties, pH levels, ambient temperature condi­tions, treatment liquid concentrations, and injection intervals) 103,105,11, 17,20,41. Recent studies have indicated that larger CaCO3 precipitation at open pore throats can seal preferential flow channels 32,36,80,104, thereby reducing permeability more directly and achieving efficient sealing. The effective degree of MICP sealing is governed by elements, such as the cumulative content and distribution pattern of CaCO3 precipitation at the microscale level. These elements, in turn, affect the macroscopic behavior of permeability reduction with the accumulation of CaCO3. In particular, porosity and permeability changes, attributed to biologically assisted CaCO3 precipitation can directly affect fluid flow and transport properties 92. A key factor relevant to permeability alteration is the characteristic pattern of precipitation with respect to the granular ma­trix, that is, precipitates localized in pore throats, pore bodies, or on grain surfaces. It has been found that there is a feedback phenomenon between the decreasing connectivity of pores owing to biomineraliza­tion and sedimentation and the local seepage features within the sand column that contribute to the formation of preferential flow 8. The CaCO3 crystal “clusters” produced by biomineralization play a dominant role in the intergranular pores, contributing to the gradual evolution of wide-area seepage paths to locally concentrated preferential flow paths 8,26. This feedback progressively directs fluids towards a small number of connectivity channels, which are cumulatively reinforced and even­tually leads to the formation of a preferential flow. In summary, the preferential flow pathway owing to the heterogeneous distribution of mineral precipitation in biocementation sands is the main reason for this phenomenon. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the microscopic characteristics of CaCO3 distribution that contribute to MICP sealing in bio-cemented soils. However, such studies are rare. To assess the interaction between the macroscopic behavior of permeability reduction and the accumulation of CaCO3, three types of sand were used under various MICP treatment schemes. The macro­scopic hydraulic parameters of the sand before and after MICP treat­ment, and the microstructure that contributes to sealing, were determined through a series of laboratory experiments, including permeability, porosity, scouring and soaking resistance tests, micro­structural testing and analysis, and microfluidic chip test. In addition, a microscopic image was used to capture the aggregation morphology of CaCO3, and the intergranular cementation patterns were analyzed by stacking, revealing the spatial heterogeneity of mineralization precipi­tation at the pore scale. The interaction between the hydraulic response behavior and microscopic precipitation accumulation in porous media was analyzed. Furthermore, the feasibility of individually distinguishing and characterizing the contributions of biofilm and CaCO3 precipitation to the reduction in porosity and permeability of biocemented sand was explored through simulations. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sand Particle shape may play a key role in controlling the number of contact points, the retention of bacteria, the spatial distribution of cal­cium carbonate precipitation, and the effective CaCO3 precipitation in biocemented sand 52,62,74,75. Particularly, sub-angular and angular shapes usually produce effective CaCO3 bonds at particle contact 100, and within the same processing time, angular particles have a larger permeability reduction than rounded particles 85. Compared to sub-rounded particles, sub-angular and angular particles can form more open structures with lower densities and fewer contact points between particles. Consequently, there are fewer particle-to-particle contacts that are effective sites for cementation to occur 45,51. The sub-rounded shape usually makes bacteria prefer to precipitate on the contact and surface of round particles; that is, compared with angular particles, round particles produce the highest carbonate content (but less effective precipitation) 100,85.

Three types of parent sands were screened, proportioned, mixed, and reconstituted at certain gradations. The particle gradation and particle size distribution of the experimental sand are presented in Fig. 1, along with the SEM morphology before the MICP treatment. The SEM images revealed that the three types of sand with differences in roundness, which are selected in our experiment, had discrete sand particles with evident pores between them. It can be observed from Fig. 1 that the three types of sand particles are concentrated in 0.25–0.50 mm, the coefficient of uniformity Cu< 5, and coefficient of curvature Cc is in the range 1–3, which is poorly graded sand (according to the Unified Soil Classification System 6). Poorly graded sands were selected for this experiment because the improvement of poorly graded sands using MICP is more reflective of the potential for biological action to enhance the performance of soils than well-graded sands, and it is easier to observe the improvement and highlight its excellence 2,47. The physical properties and mineral com­positions of the experimental sands after screening and reconstitution (pre-treatment, as aforementioned) are listed in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, for the river, sea, and quartz sands, the maximum pore ratios (emax, corresponding to the loosest state of the experimental sand) were 0.86, 0.82, and 0.79, respectively, whereas the minimum pore ratios (emin, corresponding to the densest state of the experimental sand) were 0.53, 0.49, and 0.52, respectively. The morphologies of the three sand particle types differed significantly. River sand particles are sub-angular in shape, whereas sea sand particles are typically sub-rounded with medium roundness. Most quartz sand particles had angular shapes with sharp edges and corners. Silicon was dominant in all three types of sand. In addition to silicon, there are no other significant elements present in higher proportions. 2.2. Bacterial suspension and cementation solution 2.2.1. Bacterial suspension The ureolytic bacterium Sporosarcina pasteurii (S. pasteurii) is a rod- shaped (1.3–4.0 µm in length,0.5–1.2 µm in diameter) alkalophilic heterotrophic gram-positive bacteria 27,28. The microorganism was selected as the urea hydrolysis bacterium in this study owing to its alkalophilic activity (it typically occurs in an alkaline soil environment at 30 ◦C) and lack of pathogenicity. The S. pasteurii has been proved to have the capacity to induce CaCO3 precipitation in natural soil on the premise of providing a calcium source. The bacterial suspension (BS) used in subsequent experiments was prepared (Fig. S1 and Table S1 in Note 1. S2 of Note 2 in the Supporting Information (SI) for the detailed procedure of bacterial activation and amplification cultures). The spe­cific metrics are listed in Table 2. The growth medium (nutrient broth) is utilized to provide nutrients to bacterial cells and maintain their high activity during the injection of the treatment solution 97. The rate at which S. pasteurii hydrolyzes urea is termed the urease activity. In the absence of calcium ions, urease activity was determined via solution conductivity 67,91,92 because the non-ionic substrate urea is hydrolyzed to produce ionic products, which generate a proportionate increase in conductivity under standard con­ditions. 1 ml of bacterial suspension was added to 9 ml of 1.1 M urea and 4 ml of DI water and the relative conductivity change was recorded over 5 mins at 25 oC. The urease activity was then calculated taking the dilution into account. A value of 1 U/ml of urease means an amount of urease enzyme contained in 1 ml of culture used to hydrolyze 1 μmol of urea per minute 14. To determine the concentration, activity, and growth of the ampli­fied strains, a certain amount of solution (Fig. S3b of Note 3 in the SI) was extracted from the amplified bacterial suspension (Fig. S3a of Note 3 in the SI) and placed on a visual spectrophotometer for concentration (OD600) detection (Fig. S3c of Note 3 in the SI). We further used Gram- stained specimens combined with a micro-fluidic device for microscopic observation and identification under unsterile conditions (Detailed procedure is included in Note 3 in the SI). The bacterial smears were obtained by following the general procedure of the Gram-staining method. The results showed rod-shaped, gram-positive purple cells of the bacteria approximately 2–5 µm in size (bottom right of Fig. S3d of Note 3 in the SI), signifying the stimulation of the inoculated strain when cultured under unsterile conditions. 2.2.2. Cementation solution The constituents of cementation solution (CS) considered herein primarily consist of equimolar nitrogen sources and anhydrous calcium chloride (CaCl2), in addition to part of the nutrient broth (BS can be Fig. 1.

The detailed recipes for CS, including the constituents and concentrations, used in the subse­quent experiments are summarized in Table 3. 2.3. Experimental setup and biocemented specimen preparation 2.3.1. Experimental apparatus and setup Various injection strategies for MICP treatment have been proposed in the literature on bio-mineralization in recent years 14,43,84,89,92, of which two methods (collectively called the longitudinal injection strategy in this study) are the most commonly used in practical appli­cations 37,89. Method A is known as the mixed injection strategy (Fig. 2 (a)), in which a two-phase solution (BS and CS) is first mixed and then simultaneously injected into the specimen from the injection port 16. This can be achieved in our experimental apparatus through the following process: the two-phase solution outlet pipe Normally switch at the same time (shown in green in Fig. 2(a)), the peristaltic pump is turned on and the two-phase solution is mixed and injected into the specimen at the same time. Method B is called the staged injection strategy (Fig. 2(b)), in which a one-phase solution is injected first, and then a further phase solution is injected after a certain interval 36,84. This can be achieved in our experimental apparatus through the following process: the outlet pipes of the two-phase solution are equipped with an alternating switch (red-green overlay, as shown in Fig. 2(b)) to ensure that the peristaltic pump will only extract one phase of the solution (as long as one alternating switch is on and the other alternating switches are off) to the specimen during the operation. Both of the above-mentioned strategies form cementation during the infiltration process, and several scholars have found that the simultaneous injection of two-phase solutions at low flow rates (i.e., Method A) is more likely to create larger crystal clusters 89,37, resulting in the clogging of the pore spaces of sand particles (channels for solution delivery and diffusion inside the sand specimen) near the injection port, inhibiting subsequent solution injection. For example, Tobler et al. 89 found that a mixed in­jection strategy resulted in a heterogeneous CaCO3 filling along the sand column, where most of the CaCO3 precipitation close to the inlet area. In contrast, when the staged injection strategy (i.e., Method B) was adop­ted, a more homogeneous distribution was developed. Specifically, under the mixed injection strategy, the permeability of the sand column decreased by 95%, and the backscattered electron imaging of the sand column showed that this permeability decrease was mainly due to the extensive blockage within the 1 cm of the column (total length 10 cm), and CaCO3 filled 55 ± 20% of the pore space. The rest of the column (middle and lower parts) had a small amount of CaCO3 filling, approx­imately 18 ± 8%. To avoid the heterogeneous cementation of MICP-treated sand owing to defects in the mixed injection strategy, a staged injection strategy was adopted for MICP treatment in the following experiments. This is important to ensure uniform precipita­tion 7 of CaCO3 in the entire sand column to avoid preferential flow through high porosity pathways. The experimental apparatus for MICP treatment used in this study consisted of three main parts (Fig. 2): (i) a temperature control system, (ii) a reaction system, and (iii) a measure­ment system. (i) The temperature control system includes a constant-temperature water bath device, three Erlenmeyer flasks (for BS, CS, and deionized water, from left to right, respectively), and two magnetic stirrers. Pre­cisely, two magnetic stirrers were placed under the Erlenmeyer flasks containing the BS and CS. There was also an Erlenmeyer flask containing deionized water (on the right side of the incubator). The BS and CS were avoided by continuous stirring to prevent the precipitation and strati­fication of them, which provides a sufficient guarantee for the efficient performance of the biochemical reaction inside the sand chamber (throughout the injection stage).

(ii) The reaction system consists of the sand specimen to be treated, a cylindrical mold, a peristaltic pump, an iron frame, a funnel, and a beaker. Specifically, the polyethylene (medical PP raw material) tubes with an inner diameter of 3.2 cm and a height of 11.3 cm were used as the cylindrical mold and packed with sand. Furthermore, to prevent flushing out of the sand particles with the effluent solution during treatment, filters made of the metallic grid and filter paper (20–25 µm) were laid at both the upper and lower ends of the sand specimen. An iron frame table supported the mold and the funnel under the mold, and the spilled solution was carried into the flask by a funnel for measurement and recording. (iii) The measurement system includes a beaker container, a balance, a hydraulic pump, and an effluent tank. Specifically, the drain pipe was connected to a beaker, and the liquid accumulation quality through the sand specimen was measured with a balance placed under the beaker. Finally, the perco­lating liquid accumulated in the beaker container was discharged into the effluent tank by a hydraulic pump. 2.3.2. MICP treatment schemes and biocemented specimen preparation Two-phase solutions were alternately injected into the sand speci­mens for treatment (the other phase solution was injected 8 h after the one-phase solution was injected). The volume of each solution phase was 25 ml, applied three times a day for seven days. The details of the treatment scheme are listed in Table 4. The instructions for conducting destructive and non-destructive tests under multiple treatment condi­tions for MICP-treated sand are supplemented in Note 4 of the SI, and detailed descriptions of the locations, usages, and treatment schemes of the sand specimens utilized in the current study are summarized in Table S2 of Note 4 in the SI. To prepare the specimens for biocementation in the following ex­periments, the tested sands depicted in Fig. 1 were packed into a cy­lindrical mold, as shown in Fig. 2, to form a sand column with, a diameter of 30 mm and a height of 100 mm. Furthermore, a uniform initial condition setting operation was performed on the sand columns prior to biocementation using vibration-assisted compaction to ensure that they were brought to a similar initial state. Specifically, each specimen was compacted and levelled to reach specified dry density of 1.7 Mg/m3, relative density of 38–42% and the initial porosity of 37.5–39.5% (Fig. 7 left). MICP treatment was conducted on sand col­umns in batch experiments following the staged injection strategy pre­viously reported by Wang et al. 95; the detailed preparation procedures are shown in Fig. 3. Figs. 3a and 3b show the bacterial activation, amplification culture, and BS detection. The detailed procedures are provided in the SI and shown in Figs. S1–S3. Fig. 3c shows the intuitive effect of the reaction between the BS and CS in the Petri dish. As shown in Fig. 3c, a large number of precipitates (flocculent in the early stage, gradually evolving into fibrous needle clusters in the later stage) were produced in the Petri dish after the mixing of BS and CS, and the pre­cipitates bound loose particles together. As shown in Fig. 3d, BS and CS were injected into the sand specimens using a peristaltic pump in batches (25 ml /batch) at an injection rate of 5 ml /min, with an interval of 8 h between each injection to ensure better attachment of the bacteria to the surface of the sand grains, which might otherwise wash away a large number of bacteria from the model. Then, it would not hydrolyze urea efficiently, and would not lead to a better precipitation of CaCO3. To prevent specimens from drying very quickly, excessive evaporation leading to inhomogeneous cracking or other undesirable effects, all MICP-treated sand specimens were dried and demolded at the end of the permeability test, and prior to demolding, the specimens were dried at 60 ◦C for 24 h 25,33. 2.4. Experimental testing and data acquisition 2.4.1. Permeability test Seepage is considered to be a phenomenon in liquid (such as water) flowing in porous media (e.g., soil, sand, etc.), and the ease of fluid passing through porous media is usually characterized by permeability or hydraulic conductivity 51. The permeability of MICP-treated sand depends on the pore space size, shape, and connectivity, all of which can be influenced by the CaCO3 distributions at the pore-scale. Permeability tests (Fig. 4) were conducted to evaluate the effect of MICP on seepage control and determine the hydraulic conductivity of the tested speci­mens before and after MICP treatment 36. 2.4.1.1. Constant head permeability test. The hydraulic conductivity of the untreated sand column (i.e., sand specimens before bio-treatment) was tested using the constant head permeability test method 36. In this method, the initial hydraulic conductivity (Kc) was calculated (Eq. (3) by measuring the height of the head of the measuring tube at 20 and 60 mm and the outlet permeate flow as follows: Kc = QlΔhFt(3)  2.4.1.2. Falling head permeability test. After the 10-day treatment period was completed, the variable permeability head method 36 was used to obtain the treated specimen’s (i.e., sand specimens after bio-treatment) final hydraulic conductivity (Kv), measure the water head of a thin glass tube (h1, h2) at the beginning and end of a period of time.

Kv = 2.3 alFtlog10h1h2(4)  where Q is the volumetric flow [m3], q is the flow through the specimen (F) per second [m3/s], F is the cross-sectional area of the specimen [m2], a is the cross-sectional area of the fine glass tube [m2], and l is the height of the specimen [m]. 2.4.2. Porosity test Porosity is the ratio of the volume of pores in the sand specimen (VV) to the total volume of the sand specimen (V). V can be directly measured using wax immersion volume and drainage methods 38, whereas VV can be directly measured using vacuum saturation and drying methods 38. The mold was dismantled after cooling and then put into a wax melting box to make it thoroughly waxed, and after sealing, mws was weighed. Mass mw, when placed in the water, is measured on the lifting precision electronic scale (10.5 ×5.7 ×2 cm), mws-mw is the mass of the discharged water, and volume V is obtained according to Eq. (5) (Vmax is the volume of wax used). V = mws −mwρw−Vmax(5) After determining the total volume V of the sand specimens to be tested, the molds were placed in a water bath to remove the sealing wax bodies at the upper and lower ends, dried, and then the sand bodies were saturated with water using the vacuum saturation method. The speci­mens to be tested were placed into a vacuum pressure vessel and a vacuum compression cycle was executed using nitrogen, that is, an evacuation pressure of 100 Pa and a pressurization pressure of 100 kPa were applied for 10 s in sequence, and the cycle lasted for 10 min, so that the internal pores of the sand body to be tested were saturated by sufficiently immersed water 106. The wet weight mwet was recorded after saturation, and then the specimen was placed in an oven, dried to constant weight at a constant temperature of 60 ◦C, and weighed to obtain the dry weight md. The difference between these weights is the mass of the water-filled pore space. The volume of the pore space, Vv, can be obtained by using Eq. (6). Vv = mwet −mdρw(6) Porosity n can be obtained using Eq. (7). n = VvV(7)  2.4.3. Scouring and soaking resistance tests The ability to maintain structural integrity when encountering water (i.e., scouring/erosion resistance and soaking/disintegration resistance) is a critical indicator of the amount of biocementation present in sand specimens (Fig. S4 and Videos S1–S3 of Note 4 in the SI). 2.4.4. Image capturing and stack processing Microscopic images of the tested specimens (biocemented and con­trol groups) were captured using a microscope (H-ICM-100, Ruihong, China) (Fig. 5) at the state key laboratory of reservoir geology and development of southwest petroleum university using a 10 × objective. To analyze the microstructure of the sand specimens, we employed an image-stacking method to overcome the challenge of blurred microscopic images caused by variations in height. The image-stacking method combines a set of reference frames that are similar but differ in quality or content to create a clearer image. This method can be used to create high-quality composite images using multiple similar images. Firstly, we selected at least two images with similar size and content, and then merged them into a multi-layered image using the “script load stack” option in Photoshop software. The layers were automatically Table 4 Schemes investigating the effects of variance treatment conditions on the microstructure and hydraulic characteristics of biocemented sand.

Editing the image stack involves selecting the desired smart-object layer. After editing, the smart object was auto­matically rendered in stack mode. Finally, the smart-object stack was converted into a regular-layer stack image. 2.4.5. Microfluidic chip test The fabrication process of the microfluidic chip is depicted in Fig. 6. The chip was constructed using epoxy and curing agents as the main materials. The fabrication method for the desired chip is as follows: Initially, the epoxy and curing agents were mixed in a 3:1 wt ratio and stirred at a constant rate until a limpid and wireless state was obtained. The mixture was slowly poured into a square silicon mold to a depth of 2 mm, and placed at room temperature for 24–48 h until it solidified to fabricate the base plate. Next, a “Y-shaped” ABS (Acrylonitrile Buta­diene Styrene) which was bonded with acetone was then placed over the base plate, and then, the mixture of epoxy and curing agents was poured slightly to form a layer of approximately 1 mm in height, ensuring that the mixture would not submerge the “Y-shaped” ABS structure. This allows the “Y-shaped” ABS be pulled out from the solidified mixture for a Fig. 3. Procedures for MICP treatment of experimental sand.

The chip was left at room temperature for another 24–48 h to allow for complete solidification of the epoxy mixture, resulting in the formation of a “Y-shaped” microchannel when the ABS structure was pulled out from the solidified mixture. Finally, the microchannels were sealed by covering the chip with a cover glass and bonding with epoxy and curing agents to close the gaps. Three reserved holes were left on the chip to serve as solution inlets and an effluent outlet. The injection heads were then bonded to these holes using glue to prevent liquid leakage during subsequent grouting processes. This completed the fabrication of the microfluidic chip containing embedded fluid ""Y-shaped"" channel structures. The microfluidic chip test system consisted of a microfluidic chip (obtained from Fig. 6 II), microscope (RH-ICM-100, Ruihong, China) (Fig. 5), a two-channel syringe pump (LSP02–1B, Nuowei, China), and visualization system to image, localize, and visualize the role of sand type (river, sea, and quartz sand) in MICP and their effects on the nucleation and growth behaviors of calcium carbonate. Before the MICP treatment, deionized water was flushed through the chip to expel air bubbles. The pump was connected to two injection heads to pump the solutions in the main reaction channel sat a constant injection rate (in­jection rate of 5 µm/min). An outlet was used to discharge the effluent. Throughout the MICP process, an enlarged observed area was recorded using a 5 × objective. Capturing time series microscopic images at 10- min intervals, with an image resolution of 0.77 µm/pixel, they were able to qualitatively depict the shape and size distribution of calcium carbonate over time.

All experiments were conducted at ambient temperature of 25 ◦C. 3. Results and analysis 3.1. Integrity evaluation of the biocemented sand As mentioned in Section 2.1, sea sand, which has better roundness than river and quartz sands, is not as good as them, in terms of its ability to maintain stability at the pristine stage, ability to control the number of contact points in the biocementation sand, bacterial retention, spatial distribution of calcium carbonate precipitation, and effective precipi­tation of CaCO3 75,100,45,51. Therefore, we selected sea sand as a typical research object to examine the integrity evaluation of biocementation sand, which can more intuitively determine the ability and space for biological action to enhance and improve the maintenance of the integrity of porous media (river and quartz sands are not shown in Structural integrity, and Maintain structural integrity sections) (Table S2 of Note 4 in the SI for details). As shown in Fig. 7a, there was no cementation or bonding between the particles in the sea sand (S) without MICP (Fig. 7a1), which corresponds to the type A1 treatment liquid collocation scheme (BS=OD600 =0, CS=0 M) presented in Table S2. In contrast, the MICP-treated (D2, D4, and D5 type treatment solution collocation Table S2 of Note 4 in SI for the details) sands showed different degrees of cementation block generation owing to the internal loose sand particles and pores being progressively wrapped, bonded, bridged, and plugged by different degrees of calcium carbonate precipitation (effective and ineffective cementation, cementation pattern, and precipitation space distribution) 15,55,87,89 by different concentrations of treatment solution (Figs. 7a2–7a4). The structural integrity of the MICP-treated sand deteriorated with increase in CS concentration. The maximum length of the intact blocks (IBs) was approximately10 cm (Fig. 7a4), the maximum length of the discontinuous blocks (DBs) was approximately 4 cm (Fig. 7a3), and the maximum length of the loose blocks (LBs) was less than 2 cm (Fig. 7a2) and only sporadically cemented. These were produced at low (CS =0.5 M), medium (CS = 1.5 M) and high (CS = 2.0 M) CS concentrations in the MICP-treated sand specimens. The low concentration of CS fa­cilitates the uniform precipitation of CaCO3 among sand grains, result­ing in a more homogeneous sand column as a whole, which can improve the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the soil more effectively 97. With the increasing concentration of CS, a large amount of calcium carbonate precipitated rapidly at the injection inlet, leading to a large amount of bacterial flocculation, which concentrated the precipitates at the upper end of the sand column, resulting in a drastic decrease in permeability at the upper end of the sand column (the pore space be­tween the particles surface is sealed by calcium carbonate). This pre­vented the continuous injection of the subsequent treatment solution (BS, CS) 2, making the sand column more heterogeneous as a whole, and therefore the integrity was poor compared to that of the sand column under low concentration of CS injection. When the CS concentration is reduced by half, the crystal size inside the sand column increased considerably, and the sand column strength increased significantly, whereas the increase in crystal size and soil strength was slightly larger when the CS concentration was further reduced to 0.010 mol/l/h 97. When the CS concentration was low, CaCO3 crystals generally existed in the form of single crystals and the crystals showed a better polyhedral or spheroidal shapes, whereas when the CS concentration was greater than 750 mmol/L, CaCO3 crystals showed a stacked development with fewer single crystals, mostly clustered together in a cluster 2.

This study investigates the application of MICP to enhance the hydraulic characteristics, specifically reducing porosity and hydraulic conductivity, of loose sandy soils. Three types of sand-river sand, sea sand, and quartz sand-underwent MICP treatment in cylindrical molds using multiple treatment schemes. Lab­oratory experiments, including permeability tests, porosity tests, scouring and soaking resistance tests, micro­structural testing and analysis, and microfluidic chip tests, were conducted to evaluate the hydraulic characteristics and microstructure contributing to sealing. The results revealed that the structural integrity of the MICP-treated sand declined with an increase in cementation solution (CS) concentration, which were then categorized into intact, discontinuous, and loose blocks. The average decreases in porosity and hydraulic con­ductivity were 5.5% and 97.2%, respectively, from 0.382 and 4.33 × 10-4 m/s (before treatment) to 0.361 and 1.2 × 10-5 m/s (after treatment). Three cementation patterns, G-C-G, G-G, and G-C, were identified in the MICP- treated sand, with corresponding pore-filling rates decreasing successively. Furthermore, the study explores the feasibility of individually distinguishing and characterizing the contributions of biofilms and calcium carbonate precipitation to the reduction in porosity and permeability in biocemented sand through simulation.   1. Introduction Microbially or biofilm (structured bacterial communities on surfaces in natural and anthropogenic environments defined as a matrix of mi­crobial cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS)) induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) is a promising technique for increasing the mechanical strength of soils through mineralized pre­cipitation induced by eco-friendly ureolytic bacteria, filling the pore space among soil particles 10,28,92, increasing the roughness of particle surfaces 13,68,88,90, and forming effective bridge bindings at interparticle contacts 40,70 to increase shear strength and stiffness 19,50,63,93, improve liquefaction resistance 23,71,83, retaining or reducing porosity and hy­draulic conductivity 39,73,76,82. The basic mechanism of ureolysis-based MICP is characterized by the following reaction: CO(NH2)2 + 2H2O⟶Urease CO3(2−) + 2NH4(+)(1)  CO3(2−) + Ca(2+)→CaCO3↓(2) The CaCO3 precipitates, together with the accumulated biofilm, al­ters the physicochemical properties of the system (i.e., solid phase vol­ume and roundness, environmental acidity, and basicity) 34. For water leakage control of hydraulic barriers in soil, microbial biofilms have been shown to be effective in reducing the permeability 8,48, fluid flow rate 104,32, pore throat size 104,22, free pore volumes 3,8,9 and sealing flow channels 8,9, forming barriers that reduce fluid flow through porous media26. Microbial biofilms have been proven to be effective in enhancing shear strength 104,12,57 and viscosity 3,8,9, thereby positively affecting leakage resistance. Biofilms act as collectors, and continuously attract bacteria, thereby enhancing bacterial deposition 8. As implied by Stoke’s law3,32,46, settling velocity is proportional to the square of the floc diameter and density of the microbial floc. The thicker and denser the biofilm, the faster it sinks, the higher its shear strength, and less likely to be washed away 12,32,57. Unfavorable biofilms degrade over time without a nutrient supply 81.

In the drying process, the variation of tensile strength can be divided into three parts: linear increase stage, stationary stage and slight decrease stage. The peak value of the tensile strength is much higher than that of different water contents and wetting process, and the maximum value can reach about 84 kPa.  (2) The tensile strength of remolded granite residual soil is only controlled by the suction stress under different water content conditions and in the wetting process; But the tensile strength in the drying process is also affected by the cementing force, and the peak value of the tensile strength is 4 times that in the condition of different water content and 7 times that in the wetting process.  (3) Suction stress is the source of tensile stress in soil during drying process, and the development of cracks caused by suction stress will reduce the overall tensile strength of soil. In the initial stage of drying process, the soil particles are close to each other under the action of suction stress. As the suction stress among the soil particles is different, the soil particles with weak suction stress are far away from each other, which shows the appearance and development of shrinkage cracks macroscopically.  (4) During the drying process, the pH value of the soil sample is weakly acidic, and the hydrophilic ability gradually weakens. This can lead to the formation of a stronger binding force in the soil skeleton. Therefore, for soil samples with the same moisture content, the tensile strength of the soil sample during the drying process is much greater than in the other two situations.

Tensile cracks will reduce the integrity of soil and affect the stress transfer between soil particles,10 thereby greatly reducing the soil strength.11 At present, although the research on the tensile strength of soil is not as much as the compressive strength and shear strength, it has become a factor that cannot be ignored in soil engineering problems, and many scholars have carried out related research in recent years. Existing studies on the tensile strength of clay show that the tensile strength of clay is affected by water content, suction, dry density and compaction,12–15 the tensile strength is positively correlated with the suction in the process of drying and wetting. The study on the tensile strength of sandy soil shows that the tensile strength has a great rela­tionship with water, and the tensile strength of unsaturated sandy soil is mainly controlled by the liquid bridge between particles and the pore pressure because of its low cohesion.16–19 The density also has a certain influence on tensile strength, and the general peak value is only about 1 kPa. Tensile strength and ultimate tensile strain of loess are relatively small. The tensile strength of undisturbed loess and remolded loess is negatively correlated with water content and positively correlated with dry density.20 The anisotropy of undisturbed loess is an important factor affecting its tensile strength,21 it shows brittle failure under the action of tensile stress, and the tensile strength is linearly positively correlated with the cohesion.6 The dry-wetting cycle will break the structure of the original loess, the cementation force disappears and finally be close to the tensile strength of the remolded loess.4 Expansive soil is prone to tensile failure to form tensile cracks in the process of water loss and drying due to its obvious swelling and shrinkage. According to the previous research results, the tensile strength of expansive soil peaks appears near the optimal water content, and increases linearly with the increase of dry density.22 With the increase of drying and wetting cycles, the tensile strength decreases gradually and finally tends to be stable. And the cracks will develop further with the increase of drying and wetting cycles.23 Moreover, the load has a significant inhibiting effect on the strength attenuation of the expansive soil.24 In the process of drying and water loss, the tensile strength of expansive soil increases expo­nentially with the decrease of water content, and has a positive linear correlation with suction.25,26 The tensile strength of compacted expan­sive soil increases with the increase of compaction degree.27 Some scholars use fiber or cement to improve the soil, the results show that the tensile strength is better.28–31 Granite residual soils widely distributed in South China belong to red clay, but their strength properties are quite different from those of common red clay.32 Especially for the granite residual soil with high liquid limit (liquid limit greater than 50%), the foundation and slope are more likely to produce shrinkage cracks (tensile cracks) in the process of water loss and drying after rainfall due to the existence of clay particles and hydrophilic minerals. That is to say, the tensile crack caused by tensile failure is the key factor affecting the stability of soil slope.33 During the rainfall, the water penetrates from the soil surface, and the internal moisture content increases continuously; then the soil dries gradually as the water in the soil evaporates after the rainfall. In this process, the soil goes through a dynamic process from dry to wet, and then from wet to dry. The corresponding variation of the soil tensile strength is also a dynamic process, and this process is related to the soil permeability. According to the existing related studies of granite resid­ual soil, the tensile strength of sandy granite residual soil is positively correlated with dry density and cohesion, but has little relationship with the Angle of internal friction. The tensile strength of sandy granite re­sidual soil is generally lower than that of cohesive granite residual soil.3 The cementation of chemical components such as iron and aluminum oxides provide part of the tensile strength of soil.34 Above all, there are few studies on the variation of tensile strength during wetting and drying, or just simple summary and analysis are conducted on the rule of tensile strength under the action of dry and wet. However, there is no further theoretical explanation on the formation source of the tensile strength and the main controlling factors of the tensile variation in the process of drying and wetting, and the variation rule of the tensile strength under low water content is rarely considered. In this experiment, the variations of tensile strength of remolded granite residual soil under different water content, during wetting and drying were studied using self-made horizontal direct tension apparatus. The variation of tensile strength and the microcosmic mechanism of the formation and development of shrinkage cracks were explained from the perspectives of suction stress and cementing force. 2. Testing method background Tensile strength of soils is typically measured in the laboratory by either indirect or direct methods (Fig. 1). The indirect methods mainly include the flexure test,35 Brazilian tensile test,36 double-punch test,37 and unconfined penetration test.38 The indirect method is mainly based on the theoretical formula, the soil sample is fractured or bent and then the testing result is converted to obtain the tensile strength. This method is first used to measure the tensile strength of rock, but it needs to modify the theoretical formula when it is applied to calculate the tensile strength of soil. Its advantage is that it is simple to operate, but even if the modified theoretical formula is used, the converted tensile strength is often quite different from the reality. Direct method includes uniaxial tensile method and triaxial tensile method, which also can be divided into vertical method and horizontal method. Haefeli et al. (1951), Ibarra et al. (2005), Heibrock et al. (2005), Tang et al. (2015) and Qin et al. (2021) used the vertical direct tension apparatus to measure the tensile strength of various soils.16,39–42 A major drawback of vertical direct tension apparatus is that it is difficult to determine the tensile load corresponding to the failure surface because the failure surface is affected by gravity. At present, the tensile strength of soil is mainly tested by horizontal direct tension apparatus, the most convenient and intuitive test method is uniaxial tensile test method. Generally, the two ends of soil sample are fixed by fixture or polymer adhesive (Fig. 1e), and tension is applied on both ends to make the specimen tensile dam­age, thereby directly measure the tensile strength of soil mass.6,21,22,30, 43–46 The tensile strength measured by this method is generally close to the actual value, but the disadvantage is that the soil sample is prone to damage at the fixed place, or the stress concentration in the area near the tensile fracture is generated, and it is difficult to control the position and shape of the fracture surface. Therefore, Kim and Hwang (2003) improved the traditional soil tensile test device by placing 4 triangular wedge blocks inside the soil sample box to ensure the position of the tensile section.47 Subsequently, Kim and Sture (2008) also used this device to test the tensile strength of unsaturated sand caused by capil­lary suction.17 Trabelsi et al. (2010) developed a test equipment based on the direct shear device, which used LVDT sensor to measure the displacement of soil samples, and the displacement rate could be kept constant during the test, and the magnitude of tensile force was auto­matically collected through the corresponding sensor.13 The design of the soil sample box had a gradual cross section to ensure that the tension applied at both ends of the sample device could be effectively trans­mitted to the failure surface. Tamrakar et al. (2011) and Fraccica et al. (2020) developed a new type of tensile test instrument, which can be used to conduct tensile tests on samples similar to the ""8"" section, and studied the relationship between unconfined compressive strength and tensile strength under different early consolidation pressures.48–50 For the horizontal direct tension apparatus, the inclined angle of mold side wall is the key of design. A reasonable angle allows the mold to provide sufficient ""holding force"" to avoid the soil end effect and to ensure that there is no sliding between the soil and the side wall of the mold. In view of the shortcomings of the existing soil tensile test device, Cai et al. (2017 and 2020) determined the optimal inclination angle of the side wall of the mold as 20◦through calculation and derivation.51,52 The Y.

Based on the research of Cai et al. (2017 and 2020),51,52 the tensile strength of granite residual soil in the process of drying and wetting was tested and analyzed in this experiment. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Soil collection The granite residual soil samples studied shown in Table 1 were derived from a slope (N 22◦20′51′’, E 113◦35′21′’) in Zhuhai City, Guangdong Province, China (Fig. 2). Block samples were collected by the cutting method after the stepped exploratory pit had been excavated (Fig. 2b). The intact block samples were carefully sealed by multiple layers of plastic film and waxed to preserve soil structures and minimize water content loss. Then the samples were moved into plastic box filled with Styrofoam and transported to the laboratory for performing various experiments. Granite residual soil physical properties were determined in accordance with protocol given in Chinese standard GB/ T50123–2019, which are summarized in Table 1. The grain size distri­bution, performed by Laser particle size analyzer (LA-950V2), presents that the main composition is sand particles (i.e., > 0.075 mm) with a fraction of 50.1%. The granite residual soil can be classified as low- liquid clay according to the Unified Soil Classification System. 3.2. Test procedure The improved uniaxial tensile equipment was used in this test. Ac­cording to the demonstration results of Cai et al. (2017 and 2020),51,52 the angle between the inclined surface of the fixture and the X axis di­rection was set as 20◦, shown in Fig. 2. The test device consisted of three parts: loading system, data collecting system and tensile system. The loading system mainly referred to the high precision servo motor which could provide horizontal tensile displacement. The loading displace­ment amplitude was 0–50 mm, and the loading speed accuracy was up to 0.01 mm/min. Data collecting system mainly included displacement grating, ""S"" type tension sensor (output sensitivity: 1.0–2.0 mV/V). The tensile system mainly included fixed mold, moving mold and parallel slide. The moving mold is connected with the slide by a wrapping bearing, so as to ensure that the sample in the soil sample is axial ten­sion. According to the different contents of the investigation, the following test schemes were performed:  (1) The soil particles smaller than 2 mm were selected, the distilled water was added to the target water content and compacted directly in the tensile mold to respectively make several samples with different moisture content. Then the mold with the soil sample was moved into the constant temperature and humidity box to preserve for 1 h, then carefully transferred to the uniaxial tensile tester, finally the tensile strength of the samples with different moisture content was tested respectively.  (2) To simulate the process of soil moisture gradually increasing during rainfall, the sample with 4% moisture content was firstly made in the tensile mold, and the dry density of the soil sample was controlled to remain unchanged. The water was then sprayed evenly and gradually on the surface of the sample with a sprayer to a certain moisture content. The sample was covered with a permeable stone and moved into constant temperature and hu­midity box to preserve for 1 h. Finally, the tension test was conduct. This experiment contained several sets of tensile tests with different target moisture content, the target moisture con­tent increased from 4% to saturation by 0.5%. After each test, some specimens near the tensile fracture surface were collected Fig. 1. Direct and indirect tension apparatus.

(3) To simulate the gradual drying process of soil after rainfall, a series of saturated soil samples were prepared and dried to different moisture content in a drying oven at 70 ◦C (the incre­ment of drying time was 3 min). Then the tensile strength was tested. The pre-experiment results indicated that the moisture content of the soil sample could decrease by about 0.5% when the soil sample was dried in a drying oven at 70 ℃ for 3 min. After each test, some specimens near the tensile fracture surface were collected and the actual moisture content were measured by drying method. 3.3. Scanning electron microscope/ SEM test To analyze the influence of microstructure on macroscopic me­chanical properties, representative samples were collected from the failure or fracture surface of soil samples after each test. To preserve the integrity of the surface structure (which can be damaged due to surface tension when the liquid in the soil vaporizes), the collected soil sample was frozen at −150 ◦C using liquid nitrogen. Once frozen, the sample was transferred to a pre-cooled sample table inside a vacuum freeze- dryer and subjected to 24 h of vacuumization to remove the moisture. Afterwards, the soil samples were carefully cut into small specimens measuring 1 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm in thickness for scanning elec­tron microscope (SEM) testing. The specimen surface was coated with gold before being observed under a scanning electron microscope (ΣIGMATM) at a magnification of 500 times. In this investigation, PCAS software was employed to analyze the SEM images quantitatively, including the morphological characteristics of pores and particles. 4. Testing results 4.1. Tensile strength of granite residual soil under different moisture contents The tensile strength of granite residual soil samples was tested under various moisture contents, and the results are presented in Fig. 3. The findings indicate that the tensile strength initially increases and then decreases as the moisture content rises. At low and high moisture con­tent levels, the change in tensile strength is relatively gradual, but it accelerates significantly as it approaches the peak value. The curve ex­hibits an ""convex peak"" shape, with exponential growth and decline on either side of the peak. Around 22% moisture content, the peak tensile strength reaches approximately 22 kPa. The rate of increase in tensile strength on the left side of the peak is slower than the rate of decrease on the right side. By fitting the curves on both sides of the peak, we can derive the expression for the left side as σt = 13.4ew/21.4 −14.7(1) The expression on the right side can be obtained as σt = 164e−w/13 −8.13(2) As shown in the figure, it can be observed that the range of variation in tensile strength is relatively small when the moisture content is below 10%. However, as the moisture content surpasses 10%, the tensile strength exhibits a faster increase with the rise in moisture content. Additionally, when the moisture content is below 30%, there is a rapid decline in tensile strength as the moisture content increases. Conversely, when the moisture content exceeds 30%, the decrease in tensile strength becomes more gradual. Based on the conversion of the soil three-phase index, it can be determined that the peak tensile strength of granite residual soil occurs at a saturation level of approximately 67%. 4.2. Tensile strength of granite residual soil during wetting process The tensile strength curves of remolded granite residual soil with a moisture content of 4% were subjected to wetting by adding water to various moisture contents, as depicted in Fig. 4. The results indicate that the tensile strength initially increases and then decreases with an in­crease in moisture content. On the left side of the peak value, a nonlinear increasing trend is observed, while a linear decreasing trend is observed on the right side. When the moisture content reaches approximately 20%, the peak tensile strength is around 10kPa. By fitting the curves on both sides of the peak value, the expression for the left side can be derived as follows: σt = 5.23ew/19.8 −5.68(3) The expression on the right side can be obtained as σt = −0.66w + 24.4(4) It is evident that the decreasing trend on the right side of the peak is comparatively more gradual compared to the increasing trend on the left side, resulting in a relatively lower peak tensile strength. Importantly, it Fig. 2. Direct tension apparatus.  Fig. 3. Tensile strength of remolded samples with different water content.  Y.

In contrast, the soil sample in this particular section undergoes gradual wetting from the surface, resulting in a decrease in moisture content from the outer region towards the inner region, thus leading to an uneven distribution of water. Conse­quently, this variation in water distribution differs from the results observed for tensile strength in Section 3.1. 4.3. Tensile strength of granite residual soil during drying process Fig. 5 illustrates the tensile strength of residual soil from saturated mud drying at different moisture content levels. Throughout the drying process, as the water content decreases, the variation in tensile strength can be categorized into three stages: a linear increase stage (Stage I), a stationary stage (Stage II), and a slight decrease stage (Stage III). It is noteworthy that the peak value of the tensile strength is significantly higher compared to different water content levels and wetting processes, reaching approximately 84 kPa, with an average value of around 74 kPa. In Stage I, the soil samples undergo gradual water loss and transition from a saturated state to a dry state. As the water content decreases, the tensile strength exhibits a significant increase, following a linear trend. This observation aligns with the findings of Ran et al. (2011) regarding the tensile variation of expansive soil during drying.25 The corre­sponding fitting expression can be derived as follows: σt = −3.75w + 144(5) In Stage II, as the moisture content continues to decrease, the tensile strength fluctuates within the range of 70–80 kPa, without displaying any significant increase or decrease. This indicates a stable state of high strength. The corresponding fitting expression can be derived as follows: σt = 2.67w + 44.6(6) During this stage, as the soil moisture content decreases from 5% to 0, there is a corresponding decrease in the tensile strength from 75 kPa to 55 kPa. However, even after this decrease, the final soil sample still exhibits a relatively high tensile strength. 5. Discussion 5.1. Relationship between tensile strength and microstructure Typical soil samples under different conditions were selected to analyze the changes in microstructure, as shown in Fig. 6. Generally, the original residual soil particles of granite are loosely arranged, with a non-compact structure and interconnected pores. The pore space is large, and the main mode of contact between particles is point contact, with less face-to-face contact, resulting in a small effective contact area. When immersed in water, it is easily invaded by water, and soluble minerals in the soil can dissolve, causing the granite residual soil to soften. Due to the loose arrangement of particles, under a high-powered microscope, mineral aggregates are observed to mainly exhibit non- oriented arrangements with loose sheet-like and block-like structures, oriented arrangements with loose strip-like structures, and oriented arrangements with compact sheet-like structures. There are numerous pores between minerals, which serve as natural channels for water infiltration. Under the action of water, the connections between the microstructures of the soil are disrupted. Due to the accumulation of these minor damages, they manifest as the softening and disintegration of the soil on a macroscopic level. When the moisture content in the soil is fixed at 15%, there are microscopic and medium-sized pores distrib­uted within the soil, and some cementitious materials are distributed between the particles, which contain more pores internally. This is mainly because the moisture in the wet soil is more abundant and distributed within the cementitious materials, resulting in lower tensile strength of the soil under high moisture conditions. When the moisture content is dynamically changing, especially during the gradual increase of moisture content (wetting process), the pores in the soil become larger. This is mainly because the cementitious materials between the particles continuously dissolve into the water, and at this time, the particle surfaces are covered by clay minerals, although the thickness of the covering is relatively thin. Therefore, the tensile strength of soil samples with gradually increasing moisture content is lower than that of soil samples with fixed moisture content. During the drying process, the microstructure of the soil sample un­dergoes significant changes. Although the pores in the soil sample are larger, the cementitious materials between the soil particles are more compact and form aggregates with the soil particles. These aggregates make contact with each other to form the skeleton of the soil. In this case, the tensile strength of the soil is much greater than the tensile strength of soil samples with the same moisture content under other conditions. 5.2. Relationship between tensile strength and matric suction The tensile strength of soil is determined by the interaction of physical and chemical forces between particles in different soil-water states. According to studies conducted by Tang et al. (200 and 2014) and Lu et al. (2006 and 2007), the physical stresses that primarily affect the tensile strength of soil include: (1) van der Waals attraction, (2) electrical double-layer repulsion or attraction near face-to-edge con­tacts, (3) cementation due to solute precipitation, (4) suction stress caused by pore gas pressure and pore water pressure, and (5) occlusal force between soil particles,3,18,55,62,63 as shown in Fig. 7.

If there are higher solute concentrations or fine grains subjected to drying, the intergranular stress component (3) will be more pronounced.

The soil tested in this study mainly consists of spherical or ellipsoidal particles without edges and corners. Under ten­sile loading, the forces measured on the two failure surfaces of the soil are opposite in direction, and there is no apparent dislocation between the soil particles. Therefore, it can be concluded that the occlusal force (4) has little impact on the tensile strength. Consequently, the tensile stress observed in this test is mainly attributed to the intergranular stress components (3) and (4), which essentially correspond to suction stress and cementation force. The influence of suction on tensile strength can be verified through the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC). This curve demonstrates the relationship between the matric suction (also known as capillary pres­sure) of the soil and the saturation degree (or water content),18,52,55 as shown in Fig. 8. Generally, the SWCC curve can be divided into three parts based on the water retention state: pendular, funicular, and capillary. The air-entry pressure is the capillary pressure between the funicular and capillary states. The residual saturation is defined as the saturation state between the funicular and pendular states. In the pendular regime, soil-water primarily exists as a liquid bridge between particles and a thin film of water surrounding the soil grains. For granite residual soil, the tensile strength is mainly derived from the surface tension generated by the meniscus and net force. As the soil saturation increases, the number of liquid bridges increases, resulting in an increase in tensile strength. In this test, there is no local peak near the residual moisture content. For remolded soil samples with different water content, their tensile strength increases slowly with increasing saturation. However, in the wetting process, the tensile strength of soil samples shows a more oscillating trend, while it remains relatively constant during the drying process. In the pendular state, the matric suction of the soil is much greater than the tensile strength. This indicates that matric suction does indeed have some influence on tensile strength. However, this influence is more evident in the soil’s water absorption capacity. This is why many researchers believe that suction stress, rather than matric suction, better represents the attraction be­tween particles in the water state.62 As the moisture content further increases in the funicular regime, the pores between soil particles begin to fill with water, resulting in a decrease in the surface tension of the liquid bridge and an increase in negative pore pressure. In the case of granite residual soil with a relatively uniform distribution of particles and pores, the reduction in water bridge stress is not significant. The decrease in liquid bridge stress is smaller than the increase in tensile strength caused by negative pore pressure. This leads to a total increase in tensile strength, and a maximum tensile strength is achieved when the saturation is between 55% and 65%. When the stress in the liquid bridge decreases more than the increase in tensile strength caused by negative pore pressure, the overall tensile strength gradually decreases. As capillary saturation increases, all pores become filled with water, resulting in dominant negative pore pressure. However, the overall tensile strength of the soil does not reach the maximum value observed in sandy soil. With further increase in capillary saturation, where all pores are filled with water and negative pore pressure dominates, the maximum tensile strength is not observed compared to sandy soil. This implies that the relationship between tensile strength and matric suction reaches a watershed at 55–60% soil saturation. The left side of the watershed exhibits tensile strengths lower than matric suction, while the right side shows tensile strengths greater than matric suction. In other words, when saturation exceeds 60%, factors other than matric suction, such as cementation force, start to affect the tensile strength of granite residual soil. Therefore, analyzing tensile strength solely based on matric suction is insufficient. Fig. 8.

Relationship between tensile strength and intergranular stress Comprehensively considering the theory of suction stress and cementation force, the pores between soil particles are uniformly filled with water under different water content conditions, that is, water is uniformly distributed in the pores when the soil is in the unsaturated state. Under the condition of low water content, the main form of water in soil is bound water, which is the film wrapped on the surface of soil particles. There are only a few liquid bridges between the soil particles, and the connection of suction stress transmitted by the liquid bridge is not completely established (Fig. 9a). The tensile strength is mainly determined by the direct contact between some of the clay particles, known as the cementation force. But the cementation force is small in the presence of water. As the water content increases, free water fills the pores, forming more fluid bridges between the particles (Fig. 9b). The suction stress connection between the soil particles is established due to the formation of the liquid bridge, that is, the soil particles connected by the liquid bridge forms a skeleton that could transfer the suction stress, and the tensile strength increased rapidly. When the moisture content increases, the liquid bridge pushes towards the surface of the soil par­ticles, which leads to the saturation increasing and the contact angle decreasing. this change will be shown as the increase of macroscopic suction stress at the beginning. However, as the saturation continues to increase, the decrease of contact angle and pore water pressure becomes the determinant, and the macroscopic suction stress decreases. There­fore, the suction stress increases first and then decreases with the in­crease of moisture content in the construction stage of liquid bridge. For the remolded soil, especially the soil samples that have not undergone curing, the strength of bonding force is small at high moisture content, and the influence of suction stress on the tensile strength is more direct. When the moisture content continues to increase and approaches satu­ration, the soil particles are completely wrapped by free water, the liquid bridges are interconnected and disappear, the soil loses the structure of stably transferring suction stress, and only a few pores are left unfilled by free water (Fig. 9c). At this time, the soil is in a relatively dispersed state and its tensile strength is very low. In the wetting pro­cess, free water gradually permeates and diffuses in the soil. Although this process tends to have similar moisture content in different parts of the soil over time, it cannot reach the exact same state. Therefore, the wetting process can be regarded as the disorderly superposition of the three states in Fig. 9, and there are few high stress absorption states that can effectively establish the liquid bridge connection. Therefore, when the overall strength and peak strength of the wetting process are lower than those of different water content, the change rate of the tensile strength with moisture content is small, and the curve presents a rela­tively straight convex shape. In the wetting process, the soil particles do not tend to get close to each other with the increase of moisture content, so the soil will not shrink macroscopically. The tensile strength of the drying process is controlled by both the suction stress and the bonding force. Iron cementation is the main bonding force in the granite residual soil, especially when the soil gradually changes from wet state to dry state, this effect is more obvious. In the initial drying stage of saturated soil sample, the free water near the surface soil evaporates first, and the moisture content of the surface soil is lower than that of the inside soil, resulting in gas pores (Fig. 10a). At this time, less free iron oxide is precipitated, only a small amount exists on the surface of soil particles, and the cementation between particles has not been formed. As the water continues to evaporate, the liquid-bridge connection gradually forms, the suction stress increases, the soil particles get closer to each other under the traction of the suction stress, and the volume of the soil shrinks. The free iron oxide between the soil particles also precipitates faster and forms a cementation be­tween the particles (Fig. 10b). The trend of proximity first appears in the surface soil and then develops inward. The suction stress is not equal during the soil drying process. For a single soil particle, its two sides are subjected to the suction stress from the liquid bridge between the adjacent soil particles, and the force on both sides is not equal. After the equal part is offset, the soil particle moves to the side with the greater suction stress and moves away from the soil particle on the other side. This phenomenon is macroscopically manifested as the soil shrinkage crack. The formation and development of shrinkage cracks significantly reduce the tensile strength of soil, which indicates that suction stress is not only a contributor to the tensile strength of soil, but also a destroyer of the tensile strength of soil. In stage II of Fig. 5, once the suction stress reaches the maximum, it begins to decrease as the water content continued to decrease. Free silicon oxides continue to precipitate be­tween soil particles to form a cementation, and the cementation force continues to rise, but the rate of increase is slower than that stage I of Fig. 5. This is because iron cementation is gradually formed outward from the shortest line between particles, and more free iron oxide needs to be precipitated to increase the contact area of the cementation in the later stage. At this point, the increase of the bonding force and the decrease of the suction stress basically maintain the equilibrium state, and the tensile strength shows the characteristics of stable and high strength. In stage III of Fig. 5, The water in the soil is basically in the state of bound water film, with only a few liquid bridges, and the iron cementation forms a complete skeleton among multiple soil particles (Fig. 10c). As the moisture content continues to decrease, the liquid bridge continues to lose and the bound water film becomes thin. At this time, the iron bond has been basically formed, the bond force is rela­tively unchanged, and the tensile strength shows a small decrease. 5.4. Change mechanism of tensile strength By comparing tensile strength under different conditions, it is not difficult to observe that the peak tensile strength of granite residual soil in the drying process is about 4 times of that in different water contents, and about 7 times of that in the wetting process, which indicates that the contribution of cementing force to tensile strength is more than 70%, and the peak tensile strength in the drying process shifts to the left. In addition, the tensile strength characteristics controlled by suction stress and cementation force during the drying process can also describe the Fig. 9.

Sun et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ```"

The volume shrinkage of soil in the drying process can be divided into three stages: normal shrinkage, residual shrinkage and zero shrinkage. Fig. 11 shows that the number of cracks increases rapidly within a short process of drying, starting from the surrounding areas and slowly spreading to the internal surface of the soil, which corresponds to the stage I of tensile strength in the drying process. With the decrease of moisture content, the suction stress increases gradually, and the soil particles get close to each other under the action of suction stress, and crack occurs at the place where the absorbing stress is relatively small, that is, the normal shrinkage stage. Then the number of fractures is relatively unchanged, but grad­ually expands from the surface to the interior, which indicates that the soil is still shrinking, but the suction stress is gradually weakened. Meanwhile, the cement between the soil particles under the action of temperature gradually solidifies, and the soil particles under the action of suction stress are close to each other. The amount of shrinkage be­comes smaller, which is the residual shrinkage stage, corresponding to the stage II of tensile strength. In stage III, the number and width of cracks remain basically unchanged as the soil continues to dry. The few remaining liquid bridges in the soil disappear, forming a stable iron cement, and the bonding force is enhanced. Only a small amount of the remaining water is steamed out, and the bound water film becomes thin, it corresponds to the zero shrinkage stage. This explains the formation and development of shrinkage fractures from another perspective. It is worth noting that the tensile strength of the soil samples, especially the individual fragments of the soil samples, is particularly high under the condition of complete drying, and it is difficult to stretch or break them by hand, which also shows that the bonding force plays an important role in the tensile strength of the dry soil samples. However, the tensile strength of the intact dry soil sample is lower than that of the fragments, mainly because there are relatively developed cracks in the dry soil sample, which greatly reduce the integrity of the soil sample. The overall cementation force is relatively low, resulting in the relatively low tensile strength of the soil sample. When the moisture content is dynamically changing, especially when the moisture content gradually increases (wetting process), the pores in the soil become larger. This is mainly because the binding material be­tween particles continuously dissolves into the water, resulting in a lower tensile strength compared to soil samples with a fixed moisture content. During the drying process, the microstructure of the soil sample is significantly different. Although the pores in the soil sample are larger, the binding material between soil particles is more compact and forms aggregates with the soil particles. These aggregates come into contact with each other and form the skeleton of the soil. At this point, the tensile strength of the soil is much greater than in other cases with the same moisture content soil samples (Fig. 12a). From the perspective of surface tension and contact angle, granite residual soil typically exhibits weak acidity under normal conditions. With an increase in moisture content, the pH value of the soil gradually changes from weak acidity to neutrality (Fig. 12b). Surface tension gradually increases, while the contact angle decreases. This means that the hydrophilic ability of the soil gradually strengthens, leading to a decrease in tensile strength. Therefore, when the moisture content in the soil is dynamically chang­ing, the tensile strength is lower than in the case of soil samples with a fixed moisture content. During the drying process, the pH value of the soil sample is weakly acidic, and the hydrophilic ability gradually weakens. This can lead to the formation of a stronger binding force in the soil skeleton (Fig. 12c). Therefore, for soil samples with the same moisture content, the tensile strength of the soil sample during the drying process is much greater than in the other two situations. 6. Conclusions In this experiment, self-made horizontal direct tension apparatus is used to simulate the variations of tensile strength of remolded granite residual soil during rainfall and drying, and the main conclusions are as follows:  (1) Experimental results indicate that the tensile strength of granite residual soil initially increases and then decreases under different water content conditions. During the wetting process, the tensile strength follows a similar trend, but the peak strength (10 kPa) is Fig. 10. Sketch drawing of microstructure features for the drying process.  Fig. 11.

The variations in tensile strength and the microcosmic mechanism of shrinkage crack formation and development were elucidated from the perspectives of suction stress and cementing force. Experimental results indicated that the tensile strength of granite residual soil initially increased and then decreased under different water content conditions. During the wetting process, the tensile strength followed a similar trend, but the peak strength (10 kPa) was lower compared to that under different water content conditions (22 kPa). The drying process exhibited three stages of tensile strength variation: a linear increase stage, a stationary stage, and a slight decrease stage. The peak value of the tensile strength during drying was much higher (reaching approximately 84 kPa) than that under different water content conditions and the wetting process. The tensile strength of remolded granite residual soil was solely controlled by suction stress under different water content conditions and in the wetting process. However, in the drying process, the tensile strength was also influenced by the cementing force, resulting in a peak value four times higher than that under different water content conditions and seven times higher than that in the wetting process. Suction stress served as the source of tensile stress in the soil during the drying process, and the development of cracks caused by suction stress led to a reduction in the overall tensile strength of the soil. Suction stress acted as both a contributor and a destroyer of soil tensile strength. During the drying process, the soil sample exhibited weakly acidic pH and gradually weakened hydrophilic ability. This led to the formation of stronger binding forces within the soil skeleton. Consequently, for soil samples with the same moisture content, the tensile strength during the drying process was much greater than in the other two situations. This study provides an alternative perspective on the source of soil tensile strength and its main controlling factors.   1. Introduction The tensile strength of soil is usually low and difficult to be measured. Therefore, it is often ignored for a long time and rarely considered in the previous analysis of geotechnical calculation. Most of the constitutive models proposed by many scholars only consider the stress-strain characteristics of soil in the state of compression and ignore the stress-strain relationship of soil in the state of tension. Most of the constitutive models proposed by many scholars only consider the stress- strain characteristics of soil in the state of compression and ignore the stress-strain relationship of soil in the state of tension. However, the soil is not completely pure shear failure mode in some cases, which may be the result of the joint action of shear, bulging or tension. Even in some special cases, tension becomes the main mode of soil failure,1,2 for example, in the process of slope collapse and landslide incubation, the top of the slope produced tensile cracks,3,4 the ground fracture caused by the existence of large engineering buildings, the high utilization of un­derground space and excessive exploitation of groundwater,5 and the tension failure caused by the uneven settlement of earth dam, earth embankment and embankment are closely related to the tensile strength of soil.6,7 Dry crack is another form of tension, it is resulted in the in­ternal stress caused by the volume shrinkage when the soil is dry and loses water, and it is a kind of typical tensile failure mode of soil. In the process of drying and water loss, the volume shrinkage of soil produces * Corresponding authors. E-mail addresses: sunylei@mail2.sysu.edu.cn (Y. Sun), lizhifei@stu.ynu.edu.cn (Z.

The tests performed in this study begin with dry powdered MX80 bentonite obtained from grinding of granular MX80 bentonite that was then mixed with reagent water to form a slurry, so the testing results cannot reveal the important impacts of compacted bentonite structure or the restraint provided by the host rock. Nonetheless, the free-swelling tests provide a useful reference point on the interaction between the clay particles and water at high temperatures that have fundamental effects on the bentonite buffer behavior. 2. Background Several studies on bentonite swelling behavior within temperature ranges below 100 ◦C observed a monotonic increase in swelling with temperature19,23,24,30–32, as shown in Fig. 1. The swelling strain/­pressure is an empirical quantity dependent not only on swelling po­tential but also on material structure, salinity, temperature, etc. Nevertheless, the swelling strain/pressure still reflects the material’s potential to swell under controlled experimental conditions. Evaluation of the results in Fig. 1 reveals that the swelling strain/pressure of GMZ and Kyungju bentonites exhibits a distinct upward trend with temper­atures. Meanwhile, for MX80 bentonite tested by Tripathy et al. 201519, a decrease in swelling pressure is observed with increasing tempera­tures, although only two data points are available. In addition to the usual inherent experimental uncertainties, such as cell expansion upon heating, the mineral composition of the bentonite may also affect the observed trend. An increasing trend in swelling potential with temper­ature has been observed by Ye et al. 201323, Cui et al. 201830, and Akinwunmi et al. 201933. Other studies suggest that certain physio-chemical parameters related to hydration and swelling, such as the cation exchange capacity (CEC), demonstrate a non-monotonic trend with temperature, increasing to a transition point close to 100 ◦C before decreasing with further increases in temperature34–37, as shown in Fig. 2. This phe­nomenon has been explained by the fact that the soil particle’s capacity to hold exchangeable cations is dependent on the size of the diffuse double layer and the dipolar water attracted to that layer35,36. One hy­pothesis is that when high temperatures are applied to the soil, the diffuse double layer thickness is reduced as dipolar water is removed from the DDL under elevated temperatures that carries away exchangeable cations37. An empirical equation to capture the temperature-dependency of the CEC can be expressed as follows: CEC = CECmax2{cos[απ(T −Tc)] + 1 }(1) where CECmax is the maximum value of CEC, Tc is the critical tem­perature corresponding to the CECmax, and α is a fitting parameter. Fitting results for Buckshot clay and Kütahya bentonite validate the ef­ficacy of Eq. 1 with high coefficient of determination (R2) and low root mean square error (RMSE), as shown in Fig. 2. It is possible that the observed trends in the CEC with temperature may also translate to trends in the swelling behavior at higher temper­atures. For instance, the rate of increase in the swelling pressure of so­dium bentonite in the range of 20 to 90 ◦C has been observed to decrease with increasing temperature23,25,33. Therefore, it is relevant to investi­gate the swelling behavior of bentonite under elevated temperatures above 100 ◦C to evaluate if a non-monotonic trend with temperature can also be expected. The swelling behavior is closely linked with many parameters that are necessary to simulate the buffer performance barrier system in the repository, including the maximum adsorption strength in the soil-water retention curve of Lu 201638, thermal conductivity, hydraulic conduc­tivity and swelling pressure. While recent simulation studies using mo­lecular dynamics offer theoretical contributions to hydration and swelling analysis39,40, experimental validation is still necessary. Con­ducting high-temperature swelling tests faces limitations due to the boiling point of water unless tests are performed under increased ambient pressure surpassing standard atmospheric conditions so that the water can remain a liquid in superheated conditions. Additionally, conventional lab testing may encounter challenges related to instrument deformation at elevated temperatures, affecting the accuracy of mea­surements, especially in tests like “constant volume” swelling pressure and one-dimensional swelling strain tests. While free swell testing does not consider the important effects of bentonite swelling, it provides an important indication of the interaction between bentonite particles and water. Accordingly, this study adapts the procedures for isothermal free swell testing described in ASTM D5890–1941 to permit testing at tem­peratures above 100 ◦C to gain insights into the swelling response of MX80 under high temperatures. The main outcome of the free swell test is the swell index, which is an empirical parameter that reflects the free swelling response of unstructured bentonite. The swell index is defined as the volume of bentonite slurry of 2 g bentonite power after swelling in 100 mL water41, with unit of mL/2 g. Fig. 1.

For example, Shao et al. 202242 noticed that the swell index of MX80 bentonite with a heating time of 120 days at 200 ◦C decreased by 45.1% when compared with an unheated sample. Similar observations were made by Kale and Ravi 201843 on two Barmer bentonite samples with decreases of 16.2% and 9.7%, respectively, after subjecting the samples to 200 ◦C for 28 days. 3. Material MX80 bentonite from Wyoming is a globally preferred choice of buffer material in waste disposal projects1,17. The MX80 bentonite used in this study was sourced from the American Colloid Company, initially acquired in granular form with a gravimetric water content of approx­imately 9.0%. This bentonite contains a main mineral of montmoril­lonite (85%), followed by quartz (6%), cristoballite (5%), clinoptiloite (2%), and biotite (2%)44, and has a specific gravity of 2.7645. The Atterberg limits of this bentonite are listed in Table 1. Bentonite, being a naturally occurring clay, exhibits variable Atterberg limits, but the liquid and plastic limits determined by the authors in this study align closely with values reported by Tripathy et al. 201446 and Bennett 201447. 4. Experimental investigation 4.1. Experimental setup In deep geologic repositories for nuclear waste, the pore water pressures associated with the depth below the groundwater table are expected to be on the order of hundreds of kPa and even several MPa48, 49. In this case, it is possible for superheated water to exist within the pores of the buffer material under the temperatures of up to 200 ◦C expected in the HotBENT project. To study the free swelling behavior of bentonite under temperatures above 100 ◦C, it was necessary to incor­porate a standard free swell testing setup within a pressurized vessel to prevent the boiling of water. Thus, a high-temperature high-pressure setup was designed in the study, which mainly consists of three Boro­silicate glass 3.3 (with a low expansion coefficient of 3.3 × 10–6/K) test tubes with a rack, a high-pressure stainless steel cylinder with two caps, a customized heating chamber, and a pressure panel, as illustrated in  Fig. 3a. The glass test tube meets the requirements of ASTM D5890–1941, and has a volume of 100 mL, an outer diameter of 30 mm, an inner diameter of 27 mm, and a height of 230 mm as shown in Fig. 3b. The test tubes containing a mixture of water and bentonite were held within a confining rack, which was placed within a high-pressure 316 stainless steel cell formed from a threaded cylinder with two end caps. The cylinder, manufactured in accordance with ASTM A733–1650, has an inner diameter of 73.6 mm and a height of 254 mm as shown in Fig. 3c. The assembled pressure cell was placed in a heating chamber which facilitates automated digital temperature control, allowing temperature adjustment up to 250 ◦C with a precision of 1 ◦C. Moreover, the chamber includes a PTFE air pressure tube passage through a small aperture on its side wall, which connects to the pressure panel and air booster. A Swagelok three-way valve is used to release the air pressure after the swell test for retrieval of bentonite specimens. 4.2. Test procedure Building upon the procedures described in ASTM D5890–1941, the specific procedure for conducting the swell index test on the MX80 bentonite as below: 1) Grind the granular MX80 bentonite by mortar and pestle to powdered bentonite, which passed a 75-μm (No. 200) U.S. standard sieve, and then subject the powered bentonite to oven-drying at 105 ◦C for a duration of 24 h until a consistent weight was ach­ieved. 2) Add 90 mL of reagent water to each glass test tube and place the rack containing three tubes within the heating chamber (Fig. 3b), where the temperature was either adjusted to the target temperature (for tests below 100 ◦C) or 95 ◦C (for tests above 100 ◦C). Simultaneously, set aside a bottle of water in the chamber for future use, and position the stainless steel cylinder with an unsealed top cap (Fig. 3c) inside the heating chamber. 3) Weigh out 2.00 ± 0.01 g dried bentonite and carefully dust over the entire surface of the water in the graduated cylinder twenty times, with a minimum interval of 10 min 4) After the final increment has settled, carefully rinse any adhering particles from the sides of the glass tube into the water column, raising the water volume to the 100 mL mark. 5) Remove the stainless steel cylinder and fix it to the workbench, and place the rack accommodating three test tubes meticulously inside the high-pressure steel cylinder, and then introduce the water at an identical temperature (step 2) into the gap between the inner wall of the steel cylinder and the glass test tubes, precisely up to the height marked as 100 mL on the tubes. 6) Smear a thin layer of sealant on the thread of the cylinder, and then fasten the caps and cylinder together. 7) Transfer the complete high-pressure stainless steel arrangement back into the heating chamber (Fig. 3a), apply 2 MPa air pressure to the steel cell, and then sustain the target temperature for 48 h. 8) Release the air pressure gradually through the three-way valve prior to disassembling the setup, while a cooling-down procedure to 95 ◦C was executed for the tests conducted above 100 ◦C beforehand to prevent water from boiling under atmospheric conditions. 9) Record the volumes of the settled bentonite in milliliters at the top of the settled bentonite to the nearest 0.5 mL upon disassembling the high-pressure cell. 10) Determine the gravimetric water contents of the bentonite slurry in each tube through the oven-drying method. This step involved initially extracting the clear water overlying the slurry with a syringe equipped with an extended soft tube, and subsequently extracting nearly all the settled bentonite slurry using a fresh syringe tube set. Then, the slurry was distributed into three containers to mea­sure the gravimetric water content value. Note that steps 5 and 6 were carried out at ambient temperature due to the need for a large operating space and special tools, but these procedures were executed swiftly to minimize the risk of the change in temperature affecting the bentonite behavior. This was deemed to be satisfactory as changes in bentonite volume require are comparatively slow. Additionally, the cooling stage in step 8 may affect the bentonite volume, but a comparison of slurry at temperatures below 100 ◦C before and after cooling through pre-tests indicates a difference below 5%, considering experimental error. Consequently, for the tests with target temperatures above 100 ◦C, it is sufficient to expect that bentonite volume upon cooling-down to 95 ◦C does not change quickly, as the thermo-elastic changes may occur during fast changes in temperature, but these will not have a major effect on the swell index. 5. Results and analysis A photo of the three test tubes after the free swelling test under high temperature is shown in Fig. 4. It is clear that bentonite presents a dense dispersion at the bottom of the test tube, followed by a concentrated dispersion, dilute dispersion, and reagent water on the top of the tube. Following ASTM D5890–1941, the flocculated material that is lighter in coloration than white (#B in Fig. 4) was excluded from the reading of Table 1 Atterberg limits of MX80 bentonite.

At the same time, the slurry below the flocculated material was utilized to determine gravimetric water contents with three measurements. The swell indices and measured gravimetric water con­tents for the bentonite slurries in each test tube are provided in Table 2. The evolution in swell indices and the averaged gravimetric water content from three measurements for each test tube of MX80 bentonite under various temperatures are summarized in Fig. 5. Readings display some fluctuations due to experimental variations, yet the volume of settled bentonite demonstrates an overall trend of initial growth followed by a decline as temperature rises. Furthermore, the measured gravimetric water contents of the settled MX80 bentonite are also plotted in Fig. 5. Each data point in the figure represents an average value derived from three separate measurements of the gravi­metric water content of the settled slurry taken from the same test tube. The results in Fig. 5 reveal a noteworthy upward trend in gravimetric water content as the temperature rises from 22 to approximately 88 ◦C, demonstrating an increase in the swelling potential of the bentonite. However, as the temperature continues to increase, a noticeable decrease in the gravimetric water content is observed, which implies that the swelling potential does not exhibit monotonic changes in response to increases in temperature. To establish better consistency with data reported in the literature, the gravimetric water content that was directly measured was translated into free swelling strain. The free-swelling strain can be defined in the case that changes in void ratio occur as follows: ε = ef −e0e0 + 1(2) where ε is the free swelling strain, ef is the final void ratio, and e0 is the initial void ratio that can be expressed as: e0 = Gsρwρd0−1(3) where Gs is the specific gravity, ρw is the density of water, while the water refers to bulk water under water-rich test conditions, disregarding the density difference between bulk and bound water, ρd0 is the initial dry density of powder bentonite which can be measured by a cylinder according to ASTM D7263–2151, and an approximate value of 0.97 Mg/m3 was measured in this study. In Eq. 2, the parameter ef can be calculated by: ef = ωρsρw(4) where ω is gravimetric water content, ρs is the density of soil particles which is numerically equal to Gs in the international system of units, assuming the density of water is 1.0 Mg/m3. The calculated free swelling strain is presented in Fig. 6.

Based on the form of Eq. 1 that was used to fit the temperature-dependent CEC, an empirical equation is proposed to express the temperature-dependency of free swelling strain as follows: ε = εmax2 {cos[βπ(T −Tc)] + 1 }(5) where εmax is the maximum value of swelling strain, Tc is the critical temperature assumed to equal 100 ◦C for simplicity, and β is a fitting parameter controlling the change rate with temperature. The fitted curve by Eq. 5 for the free swelling strain of MX80 is plotted in Fig. 6, and an excellent match is observed. An advantage of using Eq. 5 is that the swelling strain/pressure can be estimated for expansive soils under high temperatures (e.g., above 100 ◦C) using model parameters defined from lower temperature data (i.e., below 100 ◦C). Although the CEC was not measured for MX80 bentonite, it is possible that the α parameter in Eq. 1 is correlated with the β parameter in Eq. 5. It is possible that other mechanisms may affect the temperature de­pendency of the swelling index, which can be the focus of future studies. In addition to the CEC, mineral transformation is another significant factor that plays an important role at high temperatures. The potential for mineral transformation may explain the observation that the swelling pressure of MX80 bentonite, subjected to a high temperature of 200 ◦C for 120 days, decreased by 35.4%42. This can be attributed to the partial transformation of montmorillonite into paragonite under high-temperature conditions, as revealed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis42. Another example that highlights the impact of temperature on minerals can be observed in the case of Dong-Hae A bentonite, in which a significant decrease in the intensity of the d (001) peak at high temperatures (100, 150, 200 and 300 ◦C) for 24 h when compared to the XRD pattern at 25 ◦C52. Additionally, a decrease in the thickness of the DDL can occur at elevated temperatures. Evidence is the right shift in the (001) peak under elevated temperatures, which has been observed on both the Dong-Hae A bentonite52 and MX80 bentonite42. This shift can be attributed to the loss of interlayer water in the mineral structure. Indeed, the desorption of both strongly and weakly bound water under elevated temperatures can have a significant impact on reducing the thickness of the DDL53. The results in this study show useful empirical trends in the swelling response that may be useful for predicting these more fundamental temperature-dependent clay mineralogy effects in the future. 6. Conclusion Using a newly designed high-temperature high-pressure free swelling testing setup, a series of free swelling tests on MX80 bentonite under temperatures up to 200 ◦C was conducted to provide insight into the swelling potential of expansive soils under elevated temperatures. Free swell test data provide experimental evidence on the non- monotonic development of the swelling potential with increasing tem­perature, with an increasing-decreasing trend around a transition tem­perature close to 100 ◦C. Test results can be essential for long-term simulations of the buffer behavior of the buffer material, which requires Table 2 Swell indices and gravimetric water contents for the bentonite slurries under different temperatures.

The free swelling behavior of expansive clays under high temperature and high fluid pressure conditions that may be encountered in geological repositories for high-level radioactive waste is important as the swelling potential is closely linked with key transition points on the physical and chemical properties of these clays. Free swell tests performed at temperatures ranging from 22 to 200 ◦C under sufficient pressure to ensure that the pore water remains as a superheated liquid were performed to assess whether the swell index of bentonite follows similar non-monotonic trends with temperature as observed in the literature for the cation exchange capacity. The measured swell indices follow an increasing-decreasing trend with a transition close to 100 ◦C. The experimental results can be used to guide parameter selection in long-term simulations on the buffer behavior of the buffer material, which requires an understanding of temperature effects on the coupled thermal-hydraulic-mechanical properties governing these processes.   1. Introduction Bentonite clay is a preferred buffer and sealing material for radio­active waste geological repositories, with a barrier efficiency largely determined by its swelling capacity to create a sealed buffer zone be­tween the waste canister and the surrounding environment1–5. Over extended periods of operation, the bentonite may encounter high tem­peratures due to the decay of nuclides in the canister, and will hydrate due to groundwater infiltration under the hydrostatic water pressure in the host rock6. During hydration, the bentonite swells and effectively occupies the technological voids between the canisters, bentonite blocks, and surrounding rocks, as well as the gaps between the con­struction tunnels and surrounding rocks7–9. Swelling under low confinement conditions becomes critical in sealing potential preferential flow pathways associated with these natural or technological gaps10–12. Understanding the swelling behavior of bentonite under elevated temperatures is valuable for optimizing repository design, space utili­zation, and cost-efficiency and could also widen the range of possibilities for determining necessary interim storage periods. Many experimental studies have explored the impacts of temperature on bentonite swelling in both powdered and compacted forms, but consensus on this matter has not been achieved13. For instance, a decrease in swelling pressure with increasing temperature has been observed in several studies and was attributed to the loss of hydrating water14, movement of water molecules from the micro-pores to the macro-pores15,16, cement for­mation17,18, diffuse double layer (DDL) thickness changes19,20, etc. Meanwhile, an increase in swelling pressure at elevated temperatures has been reported in other studies due to the increase of thermal energy and diffusion of ions21, double layer repulsion22,23, as well as temper­ature effects on pore water pressure, hydration pressure, and osmotic pressure24,25. Previous experimental studies on bentonite have been carried out within restricted temperature ranges, usually spanning from ambient temperature to 80–90 ◦C. However, emerging repository conditions are now considering waste canister temperatures reaching as high as 200 ◦C26–29. For instance, the recently started full-scale in situ HotBENT experiment involves a maximum heater temperature of 200 ◦C27. Lu and McCartney 202329 conducted a tank-scale central heating test under 200 ◦C and noted an increase in the swelling pressure during the water imbibition processes in loosely compacted MX80 bentonite from that measured at ambient temperature in oedometer tests. In this study, a series of free swell tests on MX80 bentonite across temperatures from 22 to 200 ◦C was performed using a new high- temperature high-pressure cell, aiming to offer insights into the * Corresponding author.

Assuming that flow to wells is radially symmetric, the pressure depression will be in a conic shape and the hydraulic gradient of the cone of depression causes water to flow at a constant rate from the recharge boundary to the well. Such a hydraulic condition in the aquifer is known as a steady flow condition. The flux of steady radial flow Q in a confined aquifer (i.e., the reservoir is bounded on the top and bottom by impervious confining layers) with an intrinsic permeability K can be described by: Q = (2πrb)K dhdr ,(6)  where r is the radial distance from the center of the pumping well; b is the thickness of the confined reservoir; and dh/dr is the hydraulic gradient. Note that h here is the water head and water pressure can be calculated using the water head times the unit weight of water Pw = γwh. Integrating Eq. (6) gives: Q = 2πbK h(r) −hwln(rrw),(7)  where h(r) is the water head at a radial distance r from the center of the well; hw is the water head at the well boundary and rw is the radius of the well. Meanwhile, the flux in an unconfined reservoir (i.e., no top or bottom sealing layers) can be characterized by: Q = πKh2(r) −h2wln(rrw).(8) Based on Eqs. (7) and (8) and assuming a production flux of Q = 0.001 m3/s (~86 m3/day, or ~3000 standard cubic feet/day), a reservoir thickness of b = 60 m, and a production well with radius rw = 0.1 m (Note: these parameters all correspond to the Nankai Trough hydrate reservoir, Fujii et al.13), calculated hydraulic gradients away from the production well boundary are shown in Fig. 10b. Based on the logging estimate range of intrinsic permeability values for the reser­voir13, we calculate results for three permeabilities: K = 0.1, 1, and 10 mD. The results suggest that a higher hydraulic gradient is observed in confined reservoirs than in unconfined ones, and reservoirs with low intrinsic permeability tend to have higher hydraulic gradients near the wellbore. Note also that the hydraulic gradient will increase at a larger production flux or a thinner reservoir (refer to Eq. 7). This is the case for GC955 where the hydrate reservoir is a stacked sequence of hydrate-bearing sandy silt layers confined by clayey silt interbeds. Nevertheless, these results highlight that permeability measured in the laboratory using a low hydraulic gradient can overestimate the field flow performance at a much greater hydraulic gradient, particularly near the production wellbore. Although, in a reservoir with higher intrinsic permeability, the gradient near the wellbore will likely be lower (Fig. 10b). Numerical modeling of gas production from the Alaska site1 suggests the peak rate of gas production drops from 15 × 104 ST m3/day to 9.5 × 104 ST m3/day (i.e., 63 % reduction, where ST m3/day signifies standard cubic meters of gas per day) for reservoirs with a decrease in permeability from 10 mD to 0.1 mD. Reservoir modeling for the gas hydrate reservoir NGHP-02 Site 16 offshore eastern India sug­gests the production rate decrease due to the same permeability reduction (10–0.1 mD) is an order of magnitude or more25. Therefore, considering the negative impacts of increased hydraulic gradient near the production wellbore, which can reduce the effective permeability by one order of magnitude, the peak gas production rate can be expected to drop substantially. 5. Conclusions Remolded samples can yield (vertical) permeability values that are consistent with intact samples and are representative of the in situ condition; however, they do not capture the permeability anisotropy or the stress-dependent permeability anisotropy evolution of intact cores, Fig. 10.

Given the thinly interbedded nature of the GC996 sediments, relative permeability in the horizontal direction is expected to be very different from that measured in the vertical direction. Moreover, those thin, low- permeability interbed layers will tend to restrict vertical fluid flow during production and confine the reservoir response to primarily hor­izontal fluid flow. Research to estimate horizontal relative permeability to gas from the vertical relative permeability to gas with known permeability anisotropy in sediments can support more precise evalua­tion of the gas production performance for thinly-layered reservoirs. In addition to considering the effects of lithology and the flow di­rection on permeability, our study highlights the importance of considering the flow conditions themselves. Measured permeability decreases exponentially with increased hydraulic gradient. Thus, the increased hydraulic gradient near the production well can substantially lower the effective permeability in the sediments. The current method that quantifies permeability in the vertical direction under a low hy­draulic gradient (i.e., ASTM standards recommend i = 10–30) can pro­vide an upper bound on permeability, but lead to an overestimate of a reservoir’s flow performance. The hydraulic gradient near a production well increases as the pro­duction flux increases and for a thinner reservoir. The GC955 hydrate reservoir is a stacked sequence of thinly layered hydrate-bearing sandy silt sediments confined by clayey silt interbeds, implying high hydraulic gradients during gas production. Our results show that a hydraulic gradient of 500 can reduce the permeability by one order of magnitude, resulting in a significant reduction in the peak gas production rate. When evaluating reservoir flow performance, factors like perme­ability anisotropy, horizontal relative permeability, hydrate saturation, stress conditions, and hydraulic gradient must all be considered. Permeability anisotropy measured in this study uses cores from both a sandy silt and a clayey silt layer. However, the hydrate reservoir at GC955 of the Gulf of Mexico is highly interbedded with these two faces combining to form a series of thin and confined coarse layers with hy­drate, and thus, both the reservoir-scale permeability anisotropy and the hydraulic gradient near the production well are expected to be signifi­cant. The results also highlight the importance of using intact and interbedded samples to better understand their flow performance at the Gulf of Mexico hydrate reservoir.

Numerous laboratory permeability studies using local soils, glass beads, or microfluidics containing synthesized hydrates have also been reviewed23. However, reported permeability in natural hydrate-bearing sedi­ments using field or laboratory techniques, even on co-located sediment, can vary by several orders of magnitude16, possibly because these methods quantify the permeability in different directions (i.e., hori­zontal flow in XPT and vertical flow in pressure cores), across different length scales8, and are based on different simplifying assumptions47, in addition to other factors like sampling disturbance6,36. Also, ASTM standards require the unitless hydraulic gradient, i, given by i = Δh/L, where Δh (m) is the loss of water head along a distance L (m), to be 10–30 in laboratory permeability measurements. In the field, however, the gradient can be an order of magnitude or more higher, particularly near a production well38. Understanding various influencing factors and their impacts on measured permeability in hydrate-bearing sediments is of both scientific and practical importance given the prominence of permeability in dictating methane production rates from gas hydrate-bearing sediments. This study investigates permeability anisotropy and the impact of the hydraulic gradient on measured permeability in hydrate reservoir sed­iments recovered from the layered gas hydrate deposit at GC955 in the Gulf of Mexico12. Intact cores and remolded samples are characterized here. Their vertical and horizontal permeability with and without tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrate are measured at hydraulic gradients up to 500, which as derived in Section 4.3, corresponds to the gradient near the wellbore for an unconfined reservoir with 1 mD permeability. The results enhance the understanding of the hydraulic behavior of hydrate-bearing sediments in the field and highlight that permeability anisotropy, hydrate saturation, stress conditions, and hydraulic gradient have substantial impacts on reservoir permeability. 2. Experimental design 2.1. Specimen characterization The two specimens, 3FB1 (419.24–419.44 m below seafloor, mbsf) and 4FB6 (422.50 – 422.60 mbsf), investigated in this study were recovered from the Green Canyon 955 hydrate reservoir in the deep- water Gulf of Mexico as a part of the DOE/UT GOM2 field expedi­tion12. These specimens were from a coarser-grained hydrate-bearing layer and a finer-grained reservoir interbed layer respectively. As sum­marized by Flemings et al.12 and Thomas et al.36, the cores were both collected from Hole H005 (27◦0.04665’ N, 90◦25.59125’ W) with the Pressure Core Tool with Ball Valve (PCTB) in its face-bit (FB) configu­ration. Shortly after collection, the cores were scanned using the Geotek Pressure Core Analysis and Transfer System (PCATS)33. The PCATS scan of core density, compressional wave speed and X-ray imagery are given in Fig. 1. In PCATS, compressional wave speeds, vp, exceeding 2000 m/s are generally associated with the presence of gas hydrate, and speeds above 2500 m/s generally indicate high gas hydrate saturations40. The silty sands at this site can have hydrate saturation of 80 % or more27. As described by Meazell et al.24 and captured at high-resolution in their  Fig. 5, the sandy silt lithology (3FB1 in Fig. 1) has internal structure and laminations observable in the original PCATS X-ray scans taken while Fig. 1. PCATS core scans of pressure core segments from 3FB1 and 4FB6. Density tends to be slightly higher in the fine-grained interbeds (4FB6 here), but the sandy silts (3FB1 here) have higher compressional wave speeds, vp, indicative of gas hydrate. I.

By comparison, the clayey silt lithology (4FB6 in Fig. 1) is generally without structure, but can contain thin layers of coarser-grained material that can be hydrate-bearing (e.g., there is a compressional wave speed spike in 4FB6 that appears as the light band between 7 and 8 cm in the X-ray scan). These two samples were selected for this study to represent the two endmember lithologies in the GC955 gas hydrate reservoir, but it is important to recognize the layer thicknesses at GC955 were often thinner than the cores shown in Fig. 1. Based on the recovered core, Meazell et al.24 determined the coarse-grained average layer thickness was only 10.5 cm, and only 4.4 cm for the fine-grained interbeds.

The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) transported two cores (3FB1 and 4FB6) at high pressure to their Coastal and Marine Science Center laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. For the two subsamples studied here, core sections were rapidly degassed over a few minutes, then retained in their liners and shipped to the Georgia Institute of Tech­nology (Georgia Tech) without hydrate and at atmospheric pressure. The subsection from 3FB1, which originally contained high gas hydrate saturations (compressional wave speeds above 2500 m/s in Fig. 1), was highly disturbed by dissociation during the rapid depressurization and did not preserve the original sediment fabric prior to study at Georgia Tech. The subsection from 4FB6 had essentially no hydrate (compres­sional velocities below 2000 m/s in Fig. 1) and is thought to have pre­served its original sediment fabric as it was tested at Georgia Tech. Grain size analysis of the two samples, using the laser diffraction method (Mastersizer 3000E), indicates that 3FB1 is sandy silt (SM) and 4FB6 is clayey silt (CM), as shown in Fig. 2. The grain size distribution of the two tested cores in this study (solid curves) is presented together along with that of other cores recovered from the same borehole but at different depths (dashed curves). Permeability results for these samples will be discussed in later sections. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the two samples are shown in Fig. 3. The sand and silt particles in both samples are angular with sharp edges, consistent with smear- slide imagery of angular sandy silt grains from this reservoir24. This morphology suggests extensive particle crushing and little to no reworking of the sediment prior to deposition. This is consistent with earlier findings that the GC955 silty sands experienced direct, rapid deposition15. Table 1 summarizes other fundamental physical and index properties of the samples. Liquid and plastic limits are measured using the fall cone method (BS 1377). The specific surface area is determined using the methylene blue method31. Even with only 2.4 % clay in core 3FB1 and 19.1 % clay in core 4FB6, the measured specific surface areas of the two cores are relatively high (Ss = 11.3 and 111 m2/g, respectively). 2.2. A customized water retention cell Water retention curves in sediments are obtained using a customized water retention cell (Fig. 4a), in which specimens are housed within a cylindrical ring (inner diameter of 48.85 mm or 1.9 in.), sitting on top of a ceramic disc with an air-entry pressure of 1.5 MPa. Gas with a pressure lower than this air-entry pressure will be retained in the cell and only water can flow across the ceramic disc. Before the test, the ceramic disc needs to be water saturated, placed at the base of the cell, and sealed using two O-rings (one at the bottom and one at the side) to prevent gas leakage through the peripheral and bottom boundaries of the disc. Sediments of core 3FB1 are oven-dried and then air pluviated into the inner ring with an initial void ratio of e0 = 0.67 to replicate in situ packing. Carbon dioxide (CO2) gas is used to flush the sample to replace the air in the pores and then water is injected to saturate the sample. Because CO2 is much more soluble than air in water, flushing using CO2 promotes full water saturation, and residual CO2, if any, can be dissolved in water after flushing. For core 3FB1, hydrate-bearing conditions are also tested. Here, tetrahydrofuran (THF) is used as a hydrate former. THF hydrate, which can be formed in the absence of a gas phase and at room pressure, has been previously used in physical property measurements as a suitable analog for methane hydrate18,48. In particular, THF hydrate has been shown to produce a pore-scale hydrate habit analogous to what is observed for methane hydrate in granular media21,34,37. Here, a solution of 17.3THF:82.7 H2O35 is used to achieve the in situ hydrate saturation Sh = 80 % consistent with the 79–93 % measured for these GC955 sandy silt layers27. The specimen is prepared using pluviation into the THF-water solution. The entire setup and experimental process are conducted within a walk-in environmental chamber (Darwin TH055) for precise temperature control of hydrate formation and dissociation. Thermocouples are placed within the sample and the environmental chamber to monitor temperature throughout the tests. Water-saturated specimens housed within the ring are placed on the ceramic disc before assembling the cell to make it airtight. During the test, air pressure is increased stepwise and the effluent water from the cell at each pressure is measured using a high-precision scale (Denver Instrument Company, TR-104). The pressurized air invades into large pores and drains the water in them first, because the needed air pressure to overcome capillarity is smaller in larger pores. As the applied air pressure increases, water in smaller pores can then be drained. This process is repeated until no more water drains with increased air pres­sure (i.e., reaching the residual water saturation), or the maximum gas pressure of 1.5 MPa is reached (i.e., beyond which gas will percolate through the ceramic disc and no longer displaces water in the sediments). For fine sediments like the interbed sample 4FB6 with much higher suction (capillary pressures), the customized water retention cell can only drain less than 5 % water before reaching the 1.5 MPa ceramic percolation pressure. Instead, the filter paper method (ASTM D5298) is used to determine its water retention curve, enabling capillarity mea­surements at much higher pressures that can reach much lower water saturations. 2.3. A customized permeability anisotropy cell Permeability measurements are made by using a customized permeability anisotropy cell (Fig. 4b). The cell is designed to test a cubic-shaped specimen, 35.56 mm (1.4 in) on a side. All four sides of the specimen are capped with porous stones, built within cell walls thick enough to generate less than 10-6 strain (i.e., considered as zero-lateral strain condition) under 35 MPa stress. There are two fluid injection ports, one on the top cap and the other at the side wall, for vertical and Table 1 Index properties of 3FB1, 4FB6, and literature data.

For each flow measurement direction, there are two effluent ports on the opposite face. The effluent ports are connected with two isolated porous stones, an inner circular one within an outer squared one, i.e., the ‘double-ring’ method (ASTM D3385 and ASTM D5093). The outer ring removes the rigid wall effects to avoid preferential boundary flow. Only the effluent water through the inner ring (25.4 mm or 1 in in diameter) is used to determine the permeability. Although the cross-sectional area of the specimen is 35.56 x 35.56 mm2 (1.4 × 1.4 in2), the actual area for permeability measurement in each direction is only the 25.4 mm diameter circular area of the inner ring. Using Darcy’s law, the perme­ability K is measured by creating a pressure difference ΔP across the sample using ISCO pumps and monitoring the corresponding flux Q through the inner ring: K = QLΔPAinμ,(1)  where L is the height/width of the sample for vertical/horizontal flow; Ain is the area of the circular inner porous stone for the inner flow; and μ is fluid viscosity. Note that the hydraulic gradient i across the sample is proportional to the applied differential pressure ΔP as i = ΔP/(Lγw), where γw is the unit weight of water. The horizontal and vertical permeability at each stress is not measured synchronously. When measuring the vertical permeability, all horizontal injection and effluent ports are closed, and likewise for horizontal permeability measurements. For core 3FB1, sandy silt recovered from a hydrate-bearing layer, both hydrate-free and hydrate-bearing conditions are tested. For the hydrate-free condition, the reconstituted specimen is prepared using water pluviation with an initial void ratio of e0 = 0.79, which reaches e = 0.57 (i.e., porosity n = 0.36) at the in situ effective vertical stress of 4 MPa. For the hydrate-bearing condition, the same procedure in the water retention test is followed to prepare the specimen with a hydrate saturation of Sh = 80 % and an initial void ratio of e0 = 0.79. Core 4FB6, recovered from a fine-grained reservoir interbed layer, is directly cut and placed into the permeameter to preserve in situ layering and texture. Only the hydrate-free condition of this core is tested, as it was hydrate- free in situ. After specimens are prepared within the permeameter, a series of vertical stresses of σv = 10, 100, 500, 1000, and 4000 kPa is applied, with the specimen’s vertical deformation measured using a linear voltage differential transformer (LVDT). At each stress level, both the vertical and horizontal permeability is measured at a hydraulic gradient of i = 10. Once the in situ effective vertical stress of 4 MPa is reached, the permeability is measured under an array of hydraulic gradients: i = 10, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 500 to investigate the impacts of the hydraulic gradient on measured permeability under this 4MPa stress only. The maximum hydraulic gradient of 500 is chosen as the middle range of the potential hydraulic gradients seen in reservoirs, which can vary from tens to thousands depending on the reservoir permeability (see Nankai Trough reservoir-based example in Section 4.3 and Fig. 10). To minimize hydrate dissolution due to fluid injection, the permeability of the hydrate-bearing sample is measured only under stresses of σv = 10 kPa and 4 MPa. 3. Experimental results 3.1. Water retention curves Fig. 5 shows water retention curves, given here in terms of the capillary pressure Pc, and water saturation, Sw, for tested specimens during the drainage process. For core 3FB1, an air pressure of 20 kPa is first applied until the drainage of the water out of the sample stops. This process is repeated for increasing applied pressures. The maximum applied air pressure for core 3FB1 is 400 kPa. Above 400 kPa, no additional drained water can be detected by the scale with an accuracy of 0.1 mg, suggesting the residual water saturation is reached at Srw = ~5 %. For the hydrate-bearing sample, an initial water saturation Sw = 0.2 is used as hydrate occupies 80 % of the pores in the specimen. The drainage of water continues until the water saturation reaches Srw = ~2 %. For the interbed core, the procedure in ASTM D5298 is followed to prepare five specimens with different water saturations. At the end of the equilibrium phase, the matric suction for each specimen is deter­mined by using the calibration curves for Whatman No. 42 filter paper19. The van Genuchten39 model is used to fit the water retention results to obtain the values of the gas entry pressure P0, the residual water saturation Srw, and the fitting parameter m for tested samples: Pc = P0[(Sw −Srw1 −Srw)−1m−1]1−m.(2) The Brooks and Corey3 model is also utilized to fit the data points to obtain the values of the gas entry pressure P0, the residual water satu­ration Srw, and the fitting parameter λ for tested samples: Pc = P0(Sw −Srw1 −Srw)−1λ.(3) The comparison between the experimental data points and the two models shows that the van Genuchten model captures the capillary characteristics of the samples more accurately, especially at high water saturation values. Although both models include three similar parame­ters to define the curve, the van Genuchten model uses a modified and more complex version of the Brooks & Corey model to fit the data points. The three parameters obtained from the models show that the smaller pores in the interbed clayey silt sample (4FB6) require higher pressure values to allow air to enter the sample, while the required air entry pressure is the lowest for the sandy silt core without hydrate (3FB1). A similar conclusion can also be made in terms of residual water saturation at the end of the drainage process. The clayey silt specimen (4FB6) is still approximately 10 % saturated even at high pressures, while the sandy silt (3FB1) drains to lower saturations even at lower pressures. For the hydrate-bearing case (3FB1-H), the pore network clogging due to THF hydrate results in a higher air-entry pressure than in the hydrate-free case. Also, the percentage of the water trapped in the pores is slightly higher in the hydrate-bearing case (10 % of the total water in the specimen) than in the hydrate-free case (2–5 % of the total water in the specimen) due to the same reason. 3.2. Permeability during consolidation Fig. 6a shows consolidation results for the 3BF1 (with and without hydrate) and 4FB6 cores. As the vertical stress increased from the initial 10 kPa to the in situ stress of 4 MPa, the total void ratio decreases in the reconstituted sandy silt core 3FB1 are Δe = 0.23 without hydrate and Δe = 0.08 with Sh = 80 % hydrate. For the intact interbed layer, the consolidation curve shows the pre-consolidation pressure of approxi­mately 2 MPa, and the total change in void ratio is Δe = 0.29 as the vertical stress increased from 10 kPa to 6 MPa. Correspondingly, the compression index of the interbed core is Cc = 0.44, higher than that of the sandy silt core without hydrate Cc = 0.13 and with hydrate Cc = 0.047. The recompression index for the interbed core is Cr = 0.021, similar to that of the hydrate layer core Cr = 0.025 without hydrate and Cr = 0.014 with hydrate.

As expected, measured permeability decreases as the increased ver­tical effective stress reduces pore sizes. The presence of hydrate in the sandy silt core lowers the permeability by approximately a factor of 30 at the 4 MPa in situ vertical stress condition. For the hydrate-free reservoir core 3BF1, increased stress lowers both vertical and horizon­tal permeability to a similar extent. The permeability anisotropy remains nearly unchanged with increased stress Kh/Kv = ~ 1.5–1.6, possibly because this is a remolded sample with no evident sedimentation or lamination. When this reservoir core contains Sh = 80 % hydrate, the permeability anisotropy is Kh/Kv = 0.25 at 10 kPa vertical stress and eventually becomes less prominent (i.e., Kh/Kv = ~1) at 4 MPa vertical stress. However, the intact interbed core 4FB6 shows strong stress- dependent permeability anisotropy, Kh/Kv = ~1.56 at 10 kPa that became exponentially more prominent with increased stress to Kh/Kv = 0.0625 at 4 MPa (Fig. 6b). Although the horizontal permeability is slightly higher than the vertical permeability initially, which may be due to horizontal bedding, horizontal permeability decreases with increased stress much more substantially than vertical permeability, possibly because the effective void area perpendicular to the horizontal flow decreases with increasing stress while the effective void area perpen­dicular to the vertical flow remains nearly unchanged during vertical loading. Nonetheless, these results highlight that remolded samples can render the representative (vertical) permeability values of intact Fig. 6. Permeameter results.

Analyses and discussion 4.1. Pore size distribution Water retention curves play a crucial role in understanding the pore characteristics of a porous medium, including pore throat size distri­bution, connectivity, and spatial correlation. Measured capillary pres­sure Pc reflects the pore size rp through the Laplace equation Pc = 2Tscosθ/rp, where the air-water surface tension is Ts = 0.072 N/m. Assuming the contact angle is θ = 0◦, the pore size can then be estimated with known capillary pressure as rp = 2Ts/Pc. On the other hand, the amount of water contained in the pores corresponding to the calculated size rp can be determined by using the partial differentiation of water saturation with respect to capillary pressure ∂Sw/∂Pc, which indicates the frequency distribution of the pore size22. Therefore, the pore size distribution can be estimated from the van Genuchten39 model, as shown in Fig. 7. The pore size of the sandy silt core 3FB1 follows roughly a logarithmic normal distribution, with a pore size of ~2.5 µm at the peak probability. This is consistent with the mercury porosimetry measurements made on sandy silts from this reservoir9, which show a peak radius of 4.56 ± .52 µm. The formation of Sh = 80 % hydrate in this core shifts the pore size distribution leftward, i.e., reduces the overall pore sizes. Specifically, the probability of pore radii less than 1 µm in­creases, and pore radii larger than 1 µm become significantly less frequent. This may be due to hydrate formation partially clogging pores and dividing larger pores into multiple smaller pores. For the fine-grained interbed core 4FB6, the most likely pore radius is ~0.2 µm with a much wider distribution compared to the sandy silt core. This distribution confirms the reason for the highest air-entry pressure P0 and the lowest slope parameter m. 4.2. Relative and absolute permeability With known water retention curve parameters using the van Gen­uchten39 model, the relative water krw and gas krg permeability during the drainage process can be deduced (Fig. 8a): krw = S0.5[1 −(1 −S1m)m ]2krg = (1 −S)0.5[1 −S1/m]2m,(4)  where S = (Sw −Srw)/(1 −Srw) is the effective water saturation and m is the slope parameter. For the Brooks and Corey3 model, the equations for the relative permeability to water krw and to gas krg during the drainage process are (Fig. 8b): krw = S2+3λλkrg = (1 −S)2(1 −S2+λλ ),(5)  where λ is the fitting parameter. In the case of a hydrate-bearing spec­imen, the effective water saturation is S = (Sw −Srw−Sh)/(1 −Srw−Sh). In Fig. 8a, the results show that gas flow dominates the hydrate-free sandy silt sediments when S < ~0.75, the hydrate-bearing sandy silt sediments when S < ~0.65, and the interbedded clayey silt sediments when S < ~0.85. Note that the effective water saturation S describes the water volume relative to the effective pore volume (i.e., volume without hydrate, not the total pore volume). In addition, relative permeability curves derived from the Brooks & Corey model (Fig. 8b) do not show substantial differences among these three specimens, possibly because the Brooks & Corey model, compared to the van Genuchten model, does not fully capture the water retention curves, especially in the high water saturation regime (Fig. 5). By combining the water retention curves (Fig. 5) and the relative permeability curves from the van Genuchten model (Fig. 8a), a perme­ability function showing the capillarity-permeability relationship can be determined. To convert from relative permeability (Fig. 8) to phase permeability in Fig. 9, we multiply the relative permeability to water (or gas) by the absolute permeability for each core at the in situ vertical effective stress of 4 MPa and under a hydraulic gradient of i = 10 (See Fig. 6 caption). The results in Fig. 9 show a critical capillarity of approximately 200 kPa, below which the water flow is dominated by the sandy silt (3FB1) specimens, and higher than which the fine-grained interbed layer can transport more water mainly because the coarse- grained layer has almost been drained at this capillarity while the fine-grained layer is still nearly water saturated. On the other hand, the sandy silt (3FB1) layer remains the dominating gas flow pathway regardless of the capillary pressure in the system (Fig. 9b). Fig. 7.

Impacts of the hydraulic gradient Fig. 10a presents the measured permeability in the sandy silt 3FB1 core with and without hydrate, both at 4 MPa vertical effective stress, but with different hydraulic gradient conditions. Results show that an increased hydraulic gradient can lower the permeability by one order of magnitude from i = 10 (recommended by ASTM standard) to i = ~500. For the i = 500 hydraulic gradient, the corresponding water injection pressure is approximately 0.17 MPa, which may induce local compac­tion of the sediments, as well as increased flow velocity that increases flow tortuosity and friction. The effect is important to consider because the hydraulic gradient near the production wellbore can be much larger than i = 500, partic­ularly for reservoirs with low intrinsic permeability.

Permeability in hydrate-bearing sediments dictates gas and water flow rates and needs to be accurately evaluated. Published permeability studies of hydrate-bearing sediments mostly quantify vertical permeability; however, the flow is mainly horizontal during gas production in layered reservoirs. Additionally, ASTM stan­dards require a hydraulic gradient of 10–30 to be used during laboratory permeability measurements, but the gradient is much higher in the field, particularly near a production well. To address these issues, this study focuses on the hydraulic properties of a sandy silt subsample of the hydrate reservoir and a clayey silt subsample of the fine-grained, hydrate-free interbed recovered from a GC955 deep-water Gulf of Mexico gas hydrate reservoir. We characterize the sediment pore space with water retention curves for both hydrate-free and hydrate-bearing samples (hydrate saturation, Sh =80 %). Vertical deformation with increasing stress is also quantified while consolidating the samples to the 4 MPa in situ vertical effective stress. The customized per­meameter measures both the horizontal and vertical permeability with increasing stress. Results show that high hydraulic gradients lower permeability in the flow direction, possibly due to increased flow tortuosity and local sediment compaction from the high seepage force. Assuming a single permeability value, even though hydraulic gradients decrease with distance from the well, is not realistic for field estimations. The results highlight that permeability anisotropy, hydrate saturation, stress conditions, and hydraulic gradient all substantially impact reservoir permeability during production.   1. Introduction Methane gas trapped in hydrate has the potential to contribute to natural gas supplies in the future2. The characteristics of hydrate-bearing sediments play a meaningful role in the gas production rate and economic feasibility of tapping these reservoirs as energy re­sources, however5. As an example, for reservoirs with permeability K =0.1milliDarcies (mD) and 10 mD respectively, the high-permeability reservoir has a peak gas production rate that is 1.8 times that of the low-permeability reservoir during its lifetime1. Permeability, particu­larly how it evolves during production, has been shown to be one of the most crucial properties of hydrate-bearing sediments governing the economic feasibility of gas production from hydrate deposits around the world25,26,41. The permeability of hydrate-bearing sediments can be measured in situ using downhole logging tools such as the nuclear magnetic reso­nance (NMR) or the express pressure tool (XPT). NMR quantifies the permeability through empirical relations based on the NMR relaxation time13. The XPT method determines the permeability of the formation by decreasing pressure in the borehole and observing its recovery by water flow16. The development of pressure core technology in recent decades has made it possible to measure permeability in natural sedi­ments with preserved hydrate29,32. Reported permeability data include pressure cores from the Nankai Trough16,29,30,42,43, the Indian Ocean14, 28,44, the South China Sea20, the Gulf of Mexico10,47, and the Alaska Northern Slope45,46. Complementary laboratory permeability measure­ments use these natural sediments with synthesized methane or tetra­hydrofuran (THF) hydrate for parametric studies, such as to gain * Corresponding author.

The samples used in this study are homogeneous isotropic, aiming to provide a benchmark for the more complicate samples where the het­erogeneity or anisotropic arises (e.g., shale). The associated studies are in progress and recommended for future study. Honey was used as a viscous fracturing fluid in our experiments to ensures a laminar Newtonian flow into the fracture, restricting the catastrophic fracture propagation at the lab scale.3,37,69 More sensitivity studies using low viscous fluid are recommended. 6. Conclusion In this study, we developed a new brittleness index BI3 based on hydro-mechanical energy criteria and backed by an exhaustive set of new laboratory data. We correlate the wellbore pressure and strain induced by hydraulic fracturing of the six different types of synthetic samples subjected to true triaxial stresses with a lower (σv = 6.5 MPa, σH =3 MPa, and σh =1.5 MPa), and a higher (15 MPa, 10 MPa, and 5 MPa) confinement. An analytical model for the evolution of the fracturing area Ad 67 is used to quantify the non-seismic deformation energy Ed associated with hydraulic fracture propagation. The BI quantified from our proposed model (BI3) is compared to the existing models, i.e., a) based on sonic and density logs from Rickman et al.,36 and b) based on Mohr-Coulomb’s failure criteria from Papanastasiou et al.35 The con­clusions can be drawn as followings:  (1) The BI predictions based on our model (BI3) are qualitatively consistent with Papanastasiou et al.’s (BI2), but less so with Rickman et al.’s (BI1). The BI1 could only provide qualitative analysis on limited rock types.  (2) Under the higher confinement (15 MPa, 10 MPa, and 5 MPa), the value of BI2 and BI3 are relatively agreed among the brittle/semi- brittle samples (e.g., quartz-rich S1, mix-average S4, and PMMA S6); but a slight difference exists among the ductile/semi-ductile samples (e.g., clay-rich S2, calcite-rich S3, and clay-rich2 S5) (Fig. 9).  (3) From the low to higher confinement, the BI2 is unexpectedly increased among the semi-ductile (S3) and ductile samples (S2 and S5).  (4) The comparison reveals that both BI2 and BI3 are applicable to quantitative analysis in brittle/semi-brittle samples subjected to higher confinement. Our new proposed model BI3 is proved to be stress-dependent and capable of capturing the brittle-to-ductile behaviour of hydraulic fracturing within a wide range of rheo­logical samples.  (5) This study also reveals that the fracture geometry is highly dependent on not only the stress regimes, but also the brittleness/ ductility of the rock, revealing the importance of BI evaluation prior to field applications.

Appendix A. Repeatability of the fracture geometry Based on the brittleness index (BI) quantification listed in Table 2 and Fig. 9, it is found that for the brittle rock types- quartz-rich S1 (Figs. 7a and 8a), and mixed-average S4 (Figs. 7d and 8d), the tested samples exhibited a fracture plane tilted with respect to both σH and σh; while for the less brittle rock types (e.g., clay-rich S2, and calcite-rich S3), the orientation of fracture is nearly perpendicular to the σh. To assess the repeatability of our hydraulic fracturing experiments under true triaxial stresses, and better understand the conditions for which orthogonal or tilted fracture propagation occurs in these rock types, we conducted repeat experiments with additional samples under the same testing conditions. The resulting fractured samples are shown in Figs.A1 and A2. It can be seen that the fracture orientation for the quartz-rich S1 (Figs. A1a and A2a) and the mixed-average S4 (Figs. A1d and A2d) samples are repeatable, i.e., significantly tilted with respect to both σH and σh. In contrast, the calcite- rich sample S3 (Figs. A1c and A2c) exhibits a significantly less tilted fracture; and the clay-rich sample S2 (Figs. A1b and A2b) shows a nearly orthogonal fracture orientation. It turns out that the results of the additional tests suggest a good repeatability in terms of fracture orientation. Note that in this manuscript the estimations of the new Brittleness Index BI3 (Table 2) are based on the combination of all test data, including the repeat tests.Fig. A1.

Test Materials and Mechanical properties B.1 Test materials & mechanical tests To minimise the impact of heterogeneity, bedding, and defects usually found in natural rocks, we used in this study synthetic rock blocks made of silica, clay, and calcite mineral mixtures, with variable relative fractions. These minerals are most commonly found in geological materials in the Earth’s crust such as shales, sandstones, and limestones.80–84 Standard Portland cement was added to the mineral mixtures as a bonding agent for its small grain size and low toughness.85 Blocks were moulded, out of which multiple plugs and cubic samples were extracted after cement curing. The details of the mineral composition and density of the various mixtures are listed in Table B1. More details on the sample fabrication procedures can be found in 3; and 69. In addition to the mineral-cement mixtures listed in Table B1, a block of PMMA was used as an ideally homogeneous and brittle rock analogue.86–88 The complete sample set, including mineral-cement mixtures and PMMA, comprises a) 25 cylindrical sample plugs 36 mm in diameter and 72 mm in height, used for estimating the mechanical properties of each material, i.e., 10 unconfined (UCS) and 25 triaxial (TCS) compression tests on dry samples; and b) 25 dry cubic samples 50×50×50 mm3 in size, used for hydraulic fracturing tests under true triaxial stress conditions. The TCS tests were conducted in dry conditions at 0.6, 2.1, and 3.4 MPa confining pressure. More details of mechanical testing procedure can be found in 3; and 69. At least five samples of each mineral-cement mixture were prepared for testing (part of the samples is shown in Fig.B1a). The schematic of a cubic sample assembly during a typical hydraulic fracturing test is shown in Fig.B1b, along with the fluid injection wellbore and casing. A vertical 33 mm long wellbore is drilled into the sample, and the casing is introduced and glued to the wellbore down to one-third of the sample’s height (17 mm below the sample’s top surface), leaving an open hole section of 16 mm. Due to the extremely high tensile strength (above 60 MPa) of PMMA,89 the wellbore in the impermeable PMMA cubes is notched at half the height of the sample to assist fracture initiation (25 mm below the sample’s top surface).

Part of the synthetic rock samples used in this study: a) 50×50×50mm cubes for hydraulic fracturing, and 36×72mm cylindrical plugs for mechanical characterisation; b) schematic of a typical cubic sample prepared for hydraulic fracturing tests (modified from 3). . 7.1. B.2 Mechanical and petrophysical properties The mechanical properties of the mineral-cement mixtures used in this study (see Table B1) are shown in Table B2. Details of the procedures for UCS and TCS testing used to determine these values can be found in 3.Young’s modulus E ranges between 1.5 and 6.9 GPa, where the quartz-rich mixture S1 exhibits the highest value, followed by the PMMA S6, the calcite-rich mixture S3, the mixed-average mixture S4, the clay-rich mixture S2, and the lowest value was found for the clay-rich2 mixture S5. Poisson’s ratio ranges from 0.39 for PMMA, down to 0.1 for the clay-rich mixture S2; while mixtures S1, S5, S4, and S3 exhibit intermediate values comprised between 0.17 and 0.21. The internal friction angle Φ ranges between 14.4◦for PMMA and 42◦for the quartz-rich mixture S1; and the cohesion Co is comprised between 0.6 MPa for the clay-rich mixture S2 and 44.6 MPa for PMMA. Ultrasonic compressional and shear wave velocities (VP and VS, respectively) at room conditions are higher in the stiffer mixtures S1 and S6 than in the clay-rich mixtures S2 and S5. To the first order, this is attributed to the attenuation of acoustic wave by clay minerals. 90,91  Table B2 Mechanical properties of the mineral-cement mixtures and PMMA used in this study, and determined through unconfined (UCS) and triaxial (TCS) compression tests.

The depth, and therefore the in situ effective (triaxial) stress will affect the mechanical response of the rock, e.g., static and dynamic elastic properties, brit­tleness/ductility, yield/failure type, post-failure behaviour. 4,5,22,23–29 Such depth-dependent rock deformation features should be accounted for in order to devise the most reliable and efficient BI model, i.e., sensitive, discriminative, reproducible. Rickman et al. 29 proposed a practical BI model for unconventional shale reservoirs based on sonic and density logs, which provides the dynamic Young’s Modulus Edyn, and Poisson’s ratio νdyn but disregards the post-failure response of the rock, which limits the applicability of this model to relative brittleness quantification only.30 Feng et al. 3 showed that Rickman et al.’s BI model agrees only qualitatively with other models based on the post-failure behaviour of the rock. Reported limitations of this BI model include: (i) unphysical increase of the BI with confining pressure; 31 and (ii) limited discrimination between brittle and ductile depth intervals. 32,33 Despite its reported limitations, this BI model is commonly applied in the field. More recently, Papa­nastasiou et al. 34,35 proposed an analytical BI based on Mohr-Coulomb’s failure criteria, where the internal friction angle Φ, the cohesion Co, the maximum (σmax vertical) and minimum (σmin horizontal) principal stresses are accounted for in a mode-I hydraulic fracture propagation scenario. However, the BI values computed with this model are unex­pectedly low when the difference between the maxmium (σmax) and minmium stress (σmin) becomes significant.3 An alternative BI model based on hydraulic fracturing energy was recently reported by Feng et al., 3 in which the energy ratio between deformation energy Ed and injection energy EI is estimated from the wellbore pressure data, lacking of the direct strain measurements. They also experimentally examined the consistency and applicability of a total of eight distinct BI models available in the literature, including the abovementioned BI models.3 Their results indicated that the models from Rickman et al., 36 Papanastasiou et al., 35 and Feng et al. 3 followed qualitatively consistent trends for the tested rock types. However, the magnitude of the BI from Rickman et al. 36 was larger than the one from seven other BI models analysed in [3]. Feng et al. 36 also showed that the BI values from Papanastasiou et al. 35 range between 0.1 and 0.22 (under the stress conditions of σv = 8 MPa, σH = 8 MPa, σh = 0 MPa), which is significantly lower than the BI value quantified from seven other BI models. These discrepancies are worthily to be further investigated, especially for variable stress conditions. Beyond the injection rate, the hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation in geomaterials is governed by multiple parameters, including, but not limited to (i) the property of injected fluid; (ii) rock mechanical properties (elastic moduli, brittleness/ductility, mechanical strength, fracture toughness); (iii) stress state at depth; (iv) and discontinuity (natural fractures, beddings plane). 4,6,7,37,38–44 The importance of understanding the hydro-mechanical effects (fluid flow and the associated displacement) within single/multiple fractures has been demonstrated through laboratory experiments, 45–47 numerical simulations, 48–51 and field testing. 52–54 These studies reveal that for hydraulic fracturing applications the brittleness index (BI) evaluation should carefully consider the hydro-mechanical coupled behaviours. To our knowledge, no BI model based on quantification of the hydro-mechanical deformation energy subjected to true triaxial stress conditions has been proposed in the literature. Therefore, in this study, we aim to develop such BI model based on hydro-mechanical energy criteria, allowing to bypass the multiple parameters which is sometimes challenging to be accurately addressed from the field. As a compar­ison/validation, we also quantified the BI based on two BI models from literature: (i) on acoustic and dynamic elastic properties from Rickman et al. (2008), and (ii) the Mohr-Coulomb’s failure criteria from Papa­nastasiou et al. (2016). The efforts/novelty of research in this paper mainly involves: (i) A new hydro-mechanical energy-based BI model based on the direct quantification of both injection energy EI and non-seismic deformation energy Ed for the materials subjected to hydraulic fracturing is intro­duced (Section 2.2); and its applicability is demonstrated (Section 5).

The mechanical characterisation of the various rock types studied here is reported in Appendix B and involved a total of 10 UCS and 15 triaxial tests on cylindrical plugs. (iii) The results of the new and existing BI models are compared in light of these data, and the consistency between them, as well as their validity and applicability are discussed (Sections 4 and 5). 2. The Brittleness Index 2.1. Existing Brittleness Index (BI) models Feng et al. 3 recently discussed the consistency and applicability of eight published BI models, and demonstrated that the BI models based on petrophysical logs, 36 or on Mohr-Coulomb’s failure criterion 35 were qualitatively consistent with Feng et al.’s energy-based BI model for multiple rock types. 3 However, they observed significant discrepancies in terms of the BI values each model predicts for those rocks, with Rickman et al. 36.’s BI values being too large, and Papanastasiou et al.35’s BI values being too low compared to Feng et al. 3’s. As they seem to yield extreme values of BI for a wide range of rock types, these two models will be used in this study for quantification and comparison, i.e., BI1 = 12(Edyn(0.8 −ϕ) −18 −1+ vdyn −0.40.15 −0.4)(1)  BI2 = 1 −(σ1 −σ3)2CocosΦ + (σ1 + σ3)sinΦ(2)  where Edyn is the dynamic Young’s Modulus and νdyn is Poisson’s ratio determined either from sonic/density logs, or ultrasonic wave velocity measurements in the lab; ϕ is the porosity; σ1 and σ3 are the maximum and minimum principal stresses, respectively; Φ and Co are Mohr-Cou­lomb’s internal friction angle and cohesion parameters, respectively. 2.2. New hydro-mechanical energy-based Brittleness Index model 2.2.1. Model definition At a given temperature, the mechanical failure of single crystals is essentially driven by either brittle fracturing or ductile/plastic flow.55 However, in poly-crystalline mineral aggregates constituting sedimen­tary or metamorphic rocks, both failure modes coexist (semi-brittle fracturing), and their relative importance is governed by the magnitude of the prevailing mean effective stress or depth 56–58. During hydraulic fracturing of polycrystalline rocks, the supplied injection energy EI is partitioned into a) non-seismic deformation energy Ed, i.e., fracture tip resistance and separation energy necessary to overcome cohesive forces; b) kinetic energy Ek associated with crack propagation (create new fracture surface area); and c) radiated seismic energy Er. The latter term (Er) can conveniently be neglected in the energy balance, i.e., Er < < Ed and Er < < Ek.59–62 The supplied energy- injection energy EI from pump can conveniently be written as 59,60. EI = Q∫tetiP(t)dt,(3)  where Q is the constant injection rate, P(t) is the wellbore pressure during the injection period, t is time, ti is the time of hydraulic fracture initiation, and te is the time of propagation end. Considering the displacement induced by the opening hydraulic fracture (2D displace­ment field), the induced non-seismic deformation energy Ed reads Ed =∫wewiAdP(w)dw,(4)  where Ad is the temporal-evolving fracturing area (surface roughness is neglected); w is the width (displacement) resulting from the opening fracture; P(w) is the wellbore pressure corresponding to the displace­ment w, from fracture nucleation wi, to the end of fracture propagation we. In an ideally ductile rock, most of the injection energy EI is dissipated through non-seismic deformation (EI ~ Ed), while kinetic energy Ek can be neglected, i.e., Ek < < Ed.3 The opposite holds in a brittle rock, for which EI ~ Ek and Ed < < Ek. In this context, we defined a new Brittle­ness Index BI3 as the ratio of Ed/EI, BI3 = 1 −EdEI= 1 −∫wewi AdP(w)dwQ ∫t2t1 P(t)dt .(5) In practice, fracture propagation in controlled laboratory conditions can be complex, e.g., jagged or straight propagation, orthogonal to the minimum principal stress or not. In this study, we consider both: the fracture propagates perpendicular to the direction of minimum stress (e. g., horizonal stress σh); and the fracture ends up inclined with respect to both directions (e.g., horizonal stress σh and σH) (Fig. 1a). 2.2.2. Model parametrisation Considering a single vertical fracture subjected to the in-situ hori­zontal stresses σh and σH, (see Fig. 1a), the resulting normal stress on the fracture’s walls σw reads σF = σhcosθ + σHsinθ,(6)  where θ is the angle between the fracture plane and the maximum horizontal stress σH (or between the fracture’s normal vector and the minimum horizontal stress σh). The resulting fracture width (w) in this plane reads w = εhLhcosθ + εHLHsinθ(7)  where εh and εH are the strains induced by the fracture in the two hor­izontal directions, i.e., along σh and σH, respectively; while Lh and LH are the dimensions of the sample in these directions, respectively. In the case of a fracture orientation where θ = 0◦, the normal stress σw reduces to σh, and w reduces to εh × Lh. Poiseuille’s law is used to describe the flow of Newtonian fluids driven by fluid pressure within a penny-shaped fracture, 63,64 we consider a possible fluid lag often observed in laboratory experiments 64–66, i.e., the fluid radius (Rf) is smaller or approximately equal to the fracture radius (R), Rf < R, or Rf ≈R, reads q(r, t) = w(r, t) u(r, t) = −w(r, t)312μf∂pf (r, t)∂r, with 0 < r < Rf < R(8)  where q(r,t) is the flow rate per unit of fracture perimeter; w(r,t) is the width/aperture of the fracture; pf is the fluid pressure within the frac­ture; u(t) = dRf(t)/dt is the velocity of the fluid at the fluid front r =Rf(t); and µf is the viscosity of the fluid. Note that Rf = Rf(t) and R =R(t) are time-dependent radius during fracture propagation. With the mathematic transformation (detailed in [67]), the analyt­ical model for the fracturing area Ad denoted in Eqs.4 and 5 is proposed and validated by in [67], i.e., Ad =∑nm=1(ΔAR)m ≅AT∑nm=1(̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅−wm212μf(ΔPΔt)m√)∑Ni=1(̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅−wi212μf(ΔPΔt)i√), with1 ≤i ≤N and 1 ≤m ≤n ≤N(9) R.

In order to capture the strain energy dissipation with sufficient time resolution during the experiment, fracture propagation must be suffi­ciently slow. 37,68 To achieve this, a Newtonian fluid with a relatively high viscosity (i.e., honey), and a low injection rate of 0.2 cc/min were used, while the borehole pressure evolution with time is monitored. 3 Moreover, a micro-metric control needle valve Vi is used at the injection inlet to slow down the injected fluid, minimise turbulent flow into the wellbore/sample, and better mimic in the laboratory field injection conditions. 37,69 The maximum and minimum unperturbed in-situ geostresses can be estimated as σ1 = σ3(1 −ν)/ν, where ν is the Poisson’s ratio of the rock, therefore σ1 ≈4σ3 for ν = 0.2.70,71 Based on this information, we selected an analogous ratio of max/min stresses (6.5 MPa/1.5Mpa) for our lower confinement case. This ratio was selected to be lower for our higher confining case (15 MPa/5 MPa). These pre-consolidation stress ratios account for the uncertainty/risks associated with potential pre­mature damage/failure of the rock block prior to the hydraulic frac­turing test. Therefore, the stress conditions prior to injection are maintained (regulated) at low confining case of σV = 6.5 MPa (940 psi), σH = 3 MPa (440 psi), σh = 1.5 MPa (220 psi) or the higher case of σV = 15 MPa (2175 psi), σH = 10 MPa (1450 psi), σh = 5 MPa (725 psi) at all times and for all the hydraulic fracturing experiments reported here. 4. Results 4.1. Hydro-mechanical data The time of fracture initiation serves as a reference for the experi­mental evaluation of the energy partitioning during hydraulic frac­turing. The borehole pressure BHP and the three mutually orthogonal strains derived from the measured displacements are normalized by their value at this specific time. The injection energy EI (Eq.3) and the non-seismic deformation energy Ed (Eq.4) are calculated accordingly.  Figs. 3 and 4 show a typical hydro-mechanical data set acquired during the hydraulic fracturing of a quartz-rich sample S1 under the low (σv =6.5 MPa, σH = 3 MPa, σh = 1.5 MPa), and high confinement (σv =15 MPa, σH = 10 MPa, σh = 5 MPa), respectively; where by convention a negative (positive) strain indicates extension (compression). Overall, the time evolution of the three mutually orthogonal strains recorded during the experiment are significantly nonlinear. The horizontal tensile strain is essentially induced by the opening and propagation of the fracture (negative εh in green), whereas the vertical shortening is induced by the imposed vertical compressive stress σv simulating the overburden (positive εv in blue). The evolution of the three strains as a function of the borehole pressure BHP for the samples under low confinement (σV = 6.5 MPa, σH = 3 MPa, and σh = 1.5 MPa) are shown in Fig. 5. The magnitude of the strain εH along the maximum horizontal stress σH (orange curve) re­mains relatively small compared to the other two strains (from sample S1 to S5); it also remains relatively constant throughout the experiment, although a small deflection can be observed when the magnitude of εh (green curve) and εV (blue curve) exhibit the significant change with BHP during fracture propagation.

Under the higher confinement (σV = 15 MPa, σH = 10 MPa, and σh =5 MPa) (Fig. 6): The magnitude of the strain εH along the maximum horizontal stress σH (orange curve) shows slightly negative deflection for quartz-rich S1, mixed-average S4, and PMMA S6; while the significantly positive compression are observed in clay-rich S2, the calcite-rich S3, and the clay-rich2 S5. Interestingly, the largest magnitude of εh (green curve) and εV (blue curve) are observed for PMMA S6 (Fig. 6f), which is attributed to the shear-dilation failure with respect to the vertical stress (see Fig. 8f). 4.2. Hydraulic fracture geometry The representative photographs of the samples after hydraulic frac­turing are shown in Fig. 7 (low confinement) and Fig. 8 (high confine­ment). It turns out that for clay-rich S2, the calcite-rich S3, and the clay- rich2 S5 the fracture is overall orthogonal to σh, as expected. However, for the quartz-rich S1 (Fig. 7a and Fig. 8a), and the mixed-average S4 (Fig. 7d and Fig. 8d) samples, the fracture is tilted with respect to both σH and σh. The most interesting observation is a shear fracture, inter­secting the wellbore at an angle of about 45◦within the PMMA sample S6 under high confinement (Fig. 8f), rather than a vertical fracture parallel to the wellbore axis with a horizontal opening observed for the lower confinement (Fig. 7f). The repeatability of fracture geometry are reported in the Appendix A. 4.3. Energy calculation and Brittleness Index The injection energy EI, non-seismic deformation energy Ed, and the energy partitioning ratio Ed/EI are computed for the hydraulic fracturing experiments conducted on all mineral-cement mixtures and PMMA. The representative values for each material studied here are reported in  Table 1. These results show that the clay-rich rock type S2 exhibits the highest partitioning ratio (Ed /EI = 64.7%), followed by the clay-rich2 S5 (61.8%), the calcite-rich S3 (55.8%), the mixed-average S4 (43.4%), the quartz-rich S1 (32.4%); and the lowest value was recorded for the PMMA S6 (2.7%). We also observe that the partitioning ratio Ed /EI for that of higher confinement (σV = 15 MPa, σH = 10 MPa, and σh = 5 MPa) is Fig. 5.

This ratio is the highest for the mineral- cement mixture S2 (90.6%), followed by S5 (86%), S1 (65.2%), and S4 (74%); it is significantly lower for S3 (76.3%), and rather negligible for the PMMA S6 (6.1%). The brittleness indices BI1, BI2, and BI3 were calculated using Eqs.1, 2 and 5, and are listed in Table 2 for all six types of materials tested here. Note that the input parameters have been averaged prior to calculating BI1 and BI2. In this study, the BI1 is only assessed for zero confinement due to the technical limitations, while the BI2 and BI3 are quantified subjected to both low and higher confining cases. These BI values are also compared in Fig. 9. The trend of Rickman et al.’s BI1 is partially agreed with BI3 with respect to the samples of quartz-rich (S1), calcite-rich (S3) and mixed-average (S4), however, it shows notable discrepancy among the samples of clay-rich (S2 and S5) as well as the most brittle material-PMMA (S6). Overall, the BI1 is higher than BI2 and the new BI3 for all sample types except the PMMA sample S6; the most striking result is that the BI1 model fails to quantitatively reflect the brittleness of PMMA sample (S6). Under the low confinement, the Papanastasiou et al.’s BI2 is systematically the lowest for all sample types. As the increase of total confinement (see Fig. 9), the BI2 shows an unexpected increase among the samples- clay-rich S2, calcite-rich S3, and clay-rich2 S5; but a nearly constant value for samples-quartz-rich S1, and mix-average S4; while a decreased value only for sample PMMA S6. The overall value of our BI3 shows a reasonable decrease as the in­crease of confinement; and yield analogous trend across the tested ma­terials studied (except for S4) (Fig. 9). Under the high confining case, BI2 and BI3 exhibited qualitative consistency of the trend among samples S1–6. Their quantities are relatively consistent among S1, S4, and S6; but a notable discrepancy exists among S3, especially for the S2 and S5. For the higher confinement, the BI3 yields the lowest boundary of brittleness index (BI) for all synthetic samples (from S1 to S5). Interestingly, the BI based on BI2 (under the low confinement) and BI3 (under the high confinement) are shown to be quantitatively consistent, which is an unexpected result. Fig. 6.

Discussion 5.1. Dependence of the brittleness index (BI) on fracture geometry According to the BI quantification based on BI2 and BI3 (Table 2 or Fig. 9), the six types of samples are classified as brittle PMMA S6, semi- brittle quartz-rich S1 and mixed-average S4, semi-ductile calcite-rich S3, and the ductile clay-rich S2 and S5. The geometry of hydraulic fracture (HF) indicates that for semi-ductile (S3) and ductile samples (S2 and S5) the fracture propagation is nearly perpendicular to the minimum hori­zontal stress σh under either low (Fig. 7b, c and e) or high confinement (Fig. 8 b, c and e). However, for the semi-brittle samples (S1 and S4) the HF is always inclined to both σH and σh under either the low confinement (Fig. 7a and d) or high confinement (Fig. 8a and d). Interestingly, it is found that for semi-brittle samples S1 and S4 the HF geometry are still significantly inclined to both σH and σh (Fig. 8a and d) even the quan­tified BI is shown to be significantly reduced under the high confinement (Fig. 9). This is because the stronger stress effect (i.e., higher horizontal stress difference) on the samples plays a more significant role in the initiation and propagation of the hydraulic fracture for semi-brittle samples under the higher confinement (i.e., σv = 15 MPa, σH =10 MPa, σh = 5 MPa). 45 The most interesting observation is the hydraulic fracture inclined to both σV and σh for brittle PMMA (S6) under the higher confine (Fig. 8f), rather than that of inclination to both σH and σh under the low confinement (Fig. 7f). This type of shear-dilation (i.e., mixed mode-I and II propagation scenario for Fig. 8f) is also evidenced by the monitored strain data where the magnitude of vertical (εV) and horizontal strain (εh) (Fig. 6f) are significantly higher than that of mode-I fracture (Figs. 5f and 7f). Such type of shear-dilation (Fig. 8f) may be caused by the higher stress concentration at the fracture tip where the higher breakdown/propagation pressure (Fig. 6f) is subjected to normal fault­ing regimes (i.e., σV > σH > σh). 6,7,45 The results also indicate that the propagation of a hydraulic fracture is associated with the intermediate stress, especially in brittle/semi- brittle samples (Figs. 5 and 6). These observations reveal that the ge­ometry of hydraulic fracture is highly dependent on the brittleness/ ductility of the rock under true triaxial stress conditions. Such analogues phenomenon is also observed in a numerical study by Ju et al. 6. More details about the brittle/ductile behaviour on the hydromechanical response are provided in [45,72] (fluid flow, displacement, and fracture geometry). 5.2. Applicability of the new and existing BI models The comparison of the analysed BI models (Fig. 9) suggests that BI1 quantitively overestimates the BI value (except for the striking lower BI value for PMMA), which is in good agreement with the previous study. 3, 31 Furthermore, Holt et al. 31 showed that the BI value from Rickman et al. 36 increases with confining pressure, which is contradicted to the physical observations where the rock brittleness (ductility) is expected to decrease (increase) with the increasing confinement. 57,73 Therefore, the BI1 could only provide qualitative analysis on limited rock types. However, the laboratory measurement/interpretation of both P-wave and S-wave velocity on the samples subjected to in-situ conditions is always challenging.74–77 Under the lower confinement (Fig. 9), the BI2 and BI3 show a consistent trend among the different types of samples tested here; but Fig. 7.

From the low to higher confinement, the unexpected increment of BI2 is observed among the semi-ductile (S3) and ductile samples (S2 and S5). Under the high confinement, the value of BI2 shows a relatively quantitative agreement with the BI3 among the brittle/semi-brittle samples (e.g., quartz-rich S1, mix-average S4, and PMMA S6); a slight difference among the ductile/ semi-ductile samples (e.g., clay-rich S2, calcite-rich S3, and clay-rich2 S5) (Fig. 9). These observations indicates that the BI2 offers a good qualitative analysis of the brittleness among the samples exhibiting a wide range of rheology, which offers a good quantitative analysis for brittle/semi-brittle samples under the high confinement. Theoretically, the BI2 model is only limited to mode-I fracture propagation. 35 The applicability of BI2 for mixed mode-I and mode-II hydraulic fracture is required to be further investigated. These observations (Fig. 9) reveal that our new proposed model BI3 is stress-dependent and capable of capturing the brittle-to-ductile behav­iour within a wide range of rheological samples subjected to hydraulic fracturing. 5.3. Estimation of the non-seismic deformation energy at laboratory and field scales The model for the evolution of fracturing area Ad developed by our recent study (Feng et al. 67) (i.e., Eq.9) allows for the robust estimation of the non-seismic deformation energy Ed associated with hydraulic fracture propagation (Eq.4). The ratio of the non-seismic deformation energy Ed to the total injection energy EI ranges from 32% to 91% (except for PMMA), which is slightly higher than (i) published field estimations (ranging from 15–80%, see Boroumand and Eaton; 59 Maxwell et al.; 78 and Warpinski et al. 79); and comparable to (ii) laboratory-derived estimations in granite samples (ranging from 18–94%, see Goodfellow et al.60). The slight difference of Ed / EI could be attributed to a) the presence of soft/weak minerals within the distinct samples used for the studies b) simplification of the temporal fracturing area Ad estimation in the previous studies. 5.4. Limitations and future developments The prediction of the evolution of the temporal fracturing area (Ad) presented here assumes a 2D planar fracture geometry. The roughness of Fig. 8.

A variety of BI models have been developed based on rock properties such as mineralogy, elastic parameters, or constitutive law. However, very few of them are based on the hydro-mechanical interactions emerging in underground engineering applications. In this study, we propose a BI model based on the partitioning of the injection energy EI into non-seismic deformation energy Ed associated with hydraulic fracture propagation. To calculate the Ed, we apply a model for temporal fracturing area (Ad) within the penny-shaped fracture; and we also correlate the wellbore pressure and the three- dimensional strain induced by hydraulic fracturing of the different types of rock samples subjected to true triaxial stress conditions (TTSC), either σv = 6.5 MPa, σH = 3 MPa, σh = 1.5 MPa or σv = 15 MPa, σH = 10 MPa, σh = 5 MPa. As a comparison, the BI is also quantified based on the existing models: (i) acoustic measurement from Rickman et al. (2008), and (ii) the Mohr-Coulomb’s criteria from Papanastasiou et al. (2016). The Ed ranges between 32.4% and 90.6% of the total injection energy EI, which is slightly higher than the value reported from field-scale data (15% to 80%), but comparable to laboratory-derived data (18% to 94%) from literature. The results show that the predictions based on our proposed energy-based BI model are qualitatively consistent with Papanastasiou et al.’s, but less so with Rickman et al.’s. Our BI model is shown to be stress-dependent and capable of capturing the brittle-to-ductile behaviour of geomaterials subjected to hydraulic fracturing. This study demonstrates that our BI model opens a new way for quantifying the brittleness index regarding to realistic fracture propagation scenarios in field.   1. Introduction Brittleness Index (BI) has been recognized as one of the key param­eters controlling fracture development in geo-materials during reservoir stimulation, 1–7 fluid-induced seismicity, 8–10 and magma migration.11 However, the definition and quantification of a reliable BI for hydro-mechanical applications remains a challenge, i.e., the existing BI models are mainly based on rock mechanical parameters but neglect the coupled hydro-mechanical interactions associated with rock deformation at depth. A better understanding of the hydro-mechanical deformation in geo-materials can facilitate not only theoretical model­ling and the BI model development, but also provide critical insights for field applications. The deformation of a geo-material comprises several stages with shear stress increasing toward failure: Stage I – low-strain initial elastic deformation; Stage II – non-recoverable (inelastic) deformation, e.g., brittle micro-cracking, or ductile/plastic flow; Stage III – micro-cracks coalescence and macroscopic fracture propagation/strain localisation, resulting in the failure of the rock. 12–14 In this context, conventional BI Abbreviations: BI, Brittleness index; BIn,, Brittleness index model; HF, Hydraulic fracturing; TTSC, True tri-axial stress condition; TTSCs, True tri-axial stress cell; LVDT, linear Variable Differential Transformer; UCS, Uniaxial compressive strength; TCS,, Triaxial compressive strength; BHP, Bottom-hole pressure; S1–6, Type of sample; PMMA, Polymethyl Methacrylate; md, MiliDracy. * Corresponding author at: School of WASM: Minerals, Energy and Chemical Engineering, Curtin University, 26 Dick Perry Ave, Kensington, WA 6151 Australia. ** Corresponding author.

Fig. 12 displays the XRD images of sand samples with varying grouting saturation levels. The XRD analysis of the selected MICP cemented sand samples revealed distinct peaks at 29.3◦, indicating the presence of highly dense minerals. Apart from the XRD pattern of fully saturated cemented sand, the main minerals identified in the samples were quartz and calcite. The mineral composition of the silica sand primarily consists of quartz, while calcite was the only calcium car­bonate crystal type detected in all samples. Variation in the strength of mineral peaks was observed at 29.3◦among the different samples. The XRD spectra of the fully saturated samples exhibited the highest in­tensity indicating more calcium carbonate precipitation, while those of the 30% and 20% saturation samples were lower compared to the other saturation levels. The results obtained from the EDS energy spectrum, XRD analysis and SEM images confirmed that though the samples with lower satu­ration (30%) can produce more effective cementation, the samples with 100% grouting saturation had the highest calcium carbonate content which can also increase the strength of bio-cemented sand significantly, therefore, the effective cementation and the content of calcium car­bonate jointly influenced the mechanical strength, the optimal condition can be achieved by selecting an appropriate grouting saturation level. 3.2.3. X-ray computed tomography results and analysis Contact information for all the labelled grains can be obtained through the image of the particle contact surface after CT image anal­ysis. The particle coordination number refers to the count of contacts between a particle and the surrounding particles, providing information on the arrangement density within a solid. By counting the labelled particles and their corresponding contact surfaces, the coordination number of each particle can be calculated. Fig. 13 illustrates the coor­dination number statistics of particles before and after calcification for samples with grouting saturation of 30% and 70%. Additionally, the average coordination numbers before and after calcification were Fig. 13. Coordination number statistics of particles before and after calcification.  Fig. 14.

Fig. 13 demonstrates that the coordination number distri­butions for both samples slightly increase after calcification, resulting in an increase in the average coordination numbers from 5 to 6 (30% saturation) and from 4.8 to 5.8 (70% saturation), respectively. This change can be attributed to the formation of calcium carbonate, which creates new contacts or bridges between particles, leading to a slight increase in the number of particle contacts. Despite the higher propor­tion of calcium carbonate in the sample with 70% grouting saturation compared to the 30% saturation sample, the coordination numbers after calcification are quite similar for both samples. Although the increase in the average coordination number is around 1 for both cases, it signifi­cantly impacts mechanical properties such as the unconfined compres­sive strength of the samples. The contact surface area between particles with a width of one voxel was measured and calculated before and after calcification. The results are presented in Fig. 14 for samples with grouting saturation of 30% and 70%. The findings reveal that the average contact surface area of the particles after calcification is over four times greater than that of the particles before calcification. The contact surface area between particles was minimal before calcification, typically ranging from 0 to 4000 µm2, with over 65% of the contact surface areas being less than 600 µm2. This implies that the majority of the contact surface constituted less than 0.41% of the surface area of particles with the median size (SD50 =146,500 µm2, D50 = 216 µm). The low value of the contact surface area before calcification can be attributed to the fact that the contact surface primarily arises from particle-to-particle interactions, aligning with the macroscopic cohesion of untreated sand being close to zero. After calcification, the distribution of contact surface areas became more uniform, transitioning from small surfaces to larger ones. The contact surface areas ranged from 0 to 10,000 µm2. Despite the higher volume ratio of calcium carbonate in the sample with 70% grouting saturation (11.6%) compared to the sample with 30% grouting satura­tion (9.6%), the total contact surface area showed little difference be­tween the two samples. This suggests that the proportion of calcium carbonate forming bridges between particles is greater in the sample with 30% grouting saturation compared to the sample with 70% grouting saturation. This observation aligns with the close similarity in unconfined compressive strength values between the two samples in terms of macroscopic mechanical strength. Understanding and predicting the macroscopic behaviour of soil in soil micromechanics relies on an important parameter known as contact type. In untreated sand, the contact type between two sand particles is typically frictional. However, after MICP treatment, three distinct con­tact types can be identified (Fig. 15): (1) frictional contact between untreated sand particles, (2) hybrid contact involving both friction and cementation and (3) cementing contact. The cementation contact rep­resents a new type of contact formed by a calcium carbonate bridge between previously unconnected particles. In this study, the identifica­tion of extracted contact surface components (calcium carbonate or sand) enabled the quantification of different contact characteristics in each CT scanning sample. The types of contacts between particles were counted based on the composition of the contact surface, specifically distinguishing between contact surfaces consisting of only the sand, both the sand and calcium carbonate and solely calcium carbonate. The statistical results of the number and area are presented in Fig. 16. The findings indicate that the dominant contact type in samples with 30% grouting saturation is cementing contact, but the cementing con­tact area was not the highest, indicating the size and amount of calcium carbonate crystals were insufficient. The number of cementing contacts and cementing contact areas occupies a larger proportion in the samples with 30% grouting saturation compared to those with 70% grouting saturation. In addition, the hybrid contact and the hybrid contact area comprise the highest proportion for 70% grouting saturation. This can be attributed to the fact that at higher grouting saturations (70%), a larger amount of calcium carbonate crystals were produced, and they existed on the pore and particle surface, increasing the filling effect, but at lower grouting saturations (30%), the bacterial solution and cementing solution readily form liquid bridges between particles, resulting in the concentration of calcium carbonate mainly between the particles. To analyze the directional distribution of contact surfaces between particles, the normal direction of each contact surface was determined using a spherical coordinate system. The normal line represents the contact direction between particles. Within the spherical coordinate system, the normal direction of the contact surface can be defined by the polar angle φ (ranging from 0 to 2π) and the azimuth angle θ (ranging from 0 to π). Figs. 17 and 18 illustrate the directions of all contact surfaces with grouting saturations of 30% and 70% in polar coordinates, respectively. Different colours are used to distinguish the directions of frictional contacts (blue), hybrid contacts (red), and cementing contacts (purple). The results reveal that the contact directions between particles, both before and after calcification, are relatively uniform in all directions for both grouting saturations. The contact directions of the three contact types are generally isotropic. These findings indicate that, regardless of the grouting saturation level, the dynamic MICP grouting process does not induce anisotropy in the sand due to the flow direction of the Fig. 15.

Conclusion In this study, the impact of different grouting saturations on the mechanical and microstructural properties of MICP-reinforced sand was investigated. Various tests, including calcium carbonate content tests, and unconfined compressive strength tests, were conducted. Addition­ally, microscopic analysis methods such as SEM, EDS, X-ray diffraction, and CT scanning were employed to explore the mechanism of soil reinforcement under different grouting saturations. The following con­clusions were drawn:  (1) The mechanical properties of the bio-cemented sand were investigated through unconfined compressive strength tests. The unconfined compressive strength increased with more grouting times. Bio-cemented sand samples exhibited exponential in­creases in unconfined compressive strength with increasing cal­cium carbonate content under each grouting saturation. Generally, bio-cemented sand at lower grouting saturation had higher unconfined compressive strength compared to bio- cemented sand at higher grouting saturation with the same cal­cium carbonate content.  (2) SEM analysis showed an increase in calcium carbonate content with higher grouting saturation. The cementation of calcium carbonate precipitates at low saturation is mainly due to their aggregation at the particle contact. The content of calcium car­bonate generated with lower saturation after the same number of treatments is less than that of higher saturation, so large crystals have not been formed and cannot be filled between the pores as they are in the samples of higher saturations.

(4) CT scanning results demonstrated the formation of new contacts or calcium carbonate bridges between particles, resulting in a slight increase in particle coordination numbers. The contact surface area became more uniform and transitioned from small to large surfaces after calcification. Cementing contacts dominated in samples with 30% grouting saturation. Hybrid contacts and hybrid contact areas exhibited the highest proportion in samples with 70% grouting saturation. The flow direction of bacteria and the cementing solution did not induce sand anisotropy in the cementation process of MICP with different grouting saturations. Combining the above findings, we can know that bio-cemented sand samples can get higher unconfined compressive strength at lower satu­ration with the same calcium carbonate content, which means that it required less volume of bacterial solution but more times of treatment to obtain the same calcium carbonate content. Therefore, the effective cementation and content of calcium carbonate jointly influenced the improvement of soil mechanical properties.

Another is deposited on the soil grain surface, which can’t contribute apparently to the peak strength but can increase the friction angle, named non-effective cementation44. It’s worth noting that in the process of MICP reinforcement of un­saturated soil, Cheng et al.38 found that soil may obtain higher strength by microbial reinforcement under unsaturated conditions compared with fully saturated soils. It means that under unsaturated conditions, the amount of bacterial solution required for the microbial-reinforced soil to reach the target strength value would be lower, which would help reduce the cost and expand the application. At the same time, due to the water circulation in nature and the vast unsaturated soil layer in the world, the soil and reinforcement process on the engineering site are often unsaturated and have saturation changes. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct more research on the efficiency of microbial-reinforced soil under unsaturated conditions and its micro-mechanism to promote the application of microbial-reinforced granular soil in practical engineering. However, due to the difficulty in controlling the saturation of mi­crobial cementation processes and the complexity of mechanical in­fluences, the studies under unsaturated conditions are limited. And the micro-macro mechanism of microbial reinforcement of soil under un­saturated conditions is not fully understood. In view of these consider­ations, this study will focus on the effects of microbial-reinforced soil under various unsaturated conditions by conducting macro and micro­scopic tests such as unconfined compressive strength test, SEM, EDS, XRD and CT scanning. Microstructural and contact properties would be analyzed by using advanced techniques to investigate its micro mechanism. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Sample preparation 2.1.1.

The Bacillus pasteurelli employed in the experiment was acquired from Beijing Preservation Biotechnology Co., LTD, with the identifica­tion number ATCC 11859. The OD600 was about 1, and the urease ac­tivity was controlled between 8–9 mM urea hydrolysed/min. The cementing solution utilized consisted of a blend of 1 mol/L urea and calcium chloride. 2.1.2. MICP treatment procedure Acrylic columns with an inner diameter of 36 mm and 82 mm of height were produced for the experiment. These columns can be divided into two parts to ease the demolding process of the specimens. To ensure uniform injection of the MICP component, two injection pieces were installed both at the top and bottom of these columns. Porous stones with a thickness of 5 mm were also placed at the top and bottom of each column to promote uniform circulation of the injected solution within the specimens. Therefore, the sample is 36 mm in diameter and 72 mm in height. The sample preparation process has been performed as follows (Fig. 2):  (1) The sand was compacted in layers to achieve the same uniform density34. Following compaction, the mould was sealed to avoid solution outflow, and then the specimen was saturated with the bacterial solution. (2) After 12 h, pump in the cementing solution which contains cal­cium and urea. In the case of unsaturated samples, use a vacuum pump to extract different volumes of the bacterial solution ac­cording to saturation and then inject the cementing solution which contains calcium and urea. During this step, the sample was placed on a high-precision electronic balance to ensure that the quality of the sample remains unchanged to maintain the internal saturation of the sample.  (3) After 12 h, put the completed sample in the dry box at 60 C◦to dry it for 24 h and remove the mould for the next 24-hour drying. It needs to be noted that in this experiment, different times of treatment were carried out, ranging from 1 to 6. The sample was turned over after each treatment to reduce the nonuniform distribution of the solution due to the influence of gravity. And various saturation condi­tions have been employed in this study (20%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 100%).

Unconfined compressive strength tests The equipment used in the unconfined compressive strength test was the universal material tensile test machine. The loading method of the unconfined compressive strength test was displacement-controlled, and the loading rate was controlled to be 1 mm/min until the sample was damaged. After the test, the damaged sample was put into a bag and stored in a dry environment for preparation of the subsequent tests. Other chemical contamination should be avoided during the storage process. 2.3. X-ray CT scanning Following the completion of unconfined compressive strength tests, a small sample measuring approximately 1 cm3 was extracted. Xradia 620 Versa high-resolution 3D analysis system has been used for X-ray CT scanning. In order to observe calcium carbonate crystals accurately, the resolution of 0.9835 µm/px was selected for scanning, and the field of view of one scan was 1000 × 1000 × 990voxels, that is, (0.9835 ×0.9835 ×0.9835 mm3). The sample was positioned between the X-ray beam and the detector, and a rotational scan was conducted to capture X-ray projection images from various angles. The number of projected images was 990. Each projected image was then converted to a grayscale value by the computer, representing the sample’s X-ray ab­sorption. By utilizing computer reconstruction techniques, all the projected images were merged to create a three-dimensional image displaying the internal structure of the sample. The details of the scan­ned samples are presented in Table 2. 2.4. CT image analysis In this study, CT images of S30T6 and S70T6 samples (samples after six treatments with saturation of 30% and saturation of 70%) were selected to study the characteristics of MICP technology at the micro level and verify the macro test results. To obtain the contact properties of the bio-cemented sand requires three steps to treat the projected images: (1) Image processing; (2) Particle segmentation; (3) Interparticle contact surface extraction (Fig. 3). Following the scanning process, the mean filter is used to remove the noise and smooth the phase of the original image, and then the acquired images are utilized to reconstruct the internal microstructure of the sample using the filtered back projection algorithm. The pore and the solid (sand grain and calcium carbonate) phases can be easily separated by simple thresholding because of obvious density differences. To accurately quantify the microstructure, in this study, the segmentation of sand grains and calcium carbonate was achieved using the Otsu al­gorithm45 due to their similar X-ray absorption coefficients related to their densities (The density of calcium carbonate is approximately 2.71 g/cm3 and the density of silica sand is approximately 2.65 g/cm3). The grayscale histogram of sand was assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution, allowing for the definition of the threshold between sand and calcium carbonate through symmetry. After the image processing of all the slices (2D images), the 3D image can be obtained and is displayed in Fig. 4, where different colours are used to represent the gas, sand grain, and calcium carbonate. Next, the second step in image processing involves segmenting par­ticles before and after calcification. The 3D watershed algorithm was employed to detect particles within the binary 3D image that consisted of the solid phase (sand and calcium carbonate). In this study, various attempts were made on 3D images, leading to the determination of the optimal particle separation parameter as 15. Subsequently, different colours were assigned to the separated particles and markers. The con­tact between two particles was defined by a voxel cloud with a width equal to one voxel. The third stage of image processing involves extracting and labelling the contact surface between particles. The image of particle contact surface was subtracted from the segmented particle image shown in Fig. 3. Afterwards, the particle contact surface after calcification was labelled using the same procedure as for labelling the particles. Simi­larly, by applying the aforementioned method to process the image that exclusively contains sand particles, it is possible to obtain the contact Fig. 4. 2D image processing and the corresponding 3D volume.

SEM, EDS and XRD tests The SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and EDS (energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) techniques were employed to analyze the micro­structure of soil before and after cementation. The distribution of cal­cium carbonate on the surface of sand particles was observed by SEM. The chemical composition information of the sample surface, and the distribution of each element, especially calcium carbonate can be pro­vided by an EDS test. These two tests were conducted simultaneously. XRD (X-ray diffraction) technique has also been utilized to determine the crystal structure of the sample, which is crucial for comprehending its properties and behaviour. The experiments focused on sand samples treated six times using MICP technology at various saturation levels. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Unconfined compressive strength test results and analysis 3.1.1. Failure mode and stress-strain curve Fig. 5 shows the main failure modes of sand samples reinforced by MICP. The failure modes of the unsaturated sample are mainly a split failure, indicating that the integrity of the unsaturated sample after MICP reinforcement is better, the distribution of bacterial solution in the sample is relatively uniform, and the scattered particles are few. Fig. 6 illustrates the stress-strain curves of sand samples with various saturation levels and reinforcement times. Based on Fig. 6, the following observations can be made. Increasing the reinforcement times enhances the unconfined compressive strength and elastic modulus of the samples, which are in line with previous results reported by Cheng et al.38. When the reinforcement times reach the maximum value (six times), the sample with 100% saturation exhibits the highest strength, measuring 1.85 MPa. Among the unsaturated samples, the sample with 20% grouting saturation demonstrates the lowest unconfined compressive strength, averaging 0.5 MPa. Samples with 30% and 70% grouting saturation show minimal differences in strength, while the strength of the 50% saturation sample is slightly lower. Fully saturated samples exhibit higher strength compared to unsaturated samples, with a sig­nificant difference. This can be illustrated by less calcium carbonate precipitation in unsaturated samples in Section 3.1.2. Although the unconfined strength of samples with 20% saturation is relatively low, it can be inferred from the trend that the unconfined compressive strength increases rapidly with further increases in calcium carbonate content. 3.1.2. Analysis of calcium carbonate content and unconfined compressive strength After conducting the unconfined compressive strength test, the crushed specimens were gathered. The calcium carbonate content of each sample with varying times of treatments was determined using the hydrochloric acid soaking method. Subsequently, the average stress of each sample group was computed, and a mass ratio curve was plotted to depict the relationship between unconfined compressive strength and calcium carbonate content, as shown in Fig. 7. As depicted in Fig. 7, the calcium carbonate content increases with the rising number of treatments. Additionally, the unconfined compressive strength of sand samples at each grouting saturation dem­onstrates an exponential increase alongside the rise in calcium carbon­ate content, which is consistent with the rule that there is a clear strengthening of the medium with increased cementation46,47. However, sand samples cemented at unsaturated saturation exhibit higher un­confined compressive strength compared to those cemented by satu­rated grouting, despite having the same calcium carbonate content, which was also similar to the previous observation by Cheng et al.38. Because the calcium carbonate content is not equal to the quantity of cementation. There are two patterns of calcium carbonate precipitation. One is that the calcium carbonate would precipitate on the surface of particles, this can only increase the friction angle but not strength effectively, if only the calcium carbonate precipitate between the soil particles, especially where they are in contact, this kind of cementation would enhance the strength effectively and this is called “effective cementation”. The more “effective cementation” (not total calcium carbonate content) is, the higher the strength is. When the grouting process of MICP is under unsaturated condition (especially the lower condition), the calcium carbonate is more likely to precipitate between the particles leading to more effective cementation. And we also found that the sample with 30% grouting saturation and the sample with 70% grouting saturation had similar strength after each same time of treatment: The unconfined compressive strength of the sample with 30% grouting saturation after six times treatments is 1.48 MPa, while that of the sample with 70% grouting saturation after six times treatments is 1.35 MPa. Both strengths are similar, but the sample with 30% grouting saturation has a calcium carbonate content of only 3.4%, which is 0.65 times that of the sample with 70% grouting saturation. Therefore, these two samples were selected for CT scanning and microstructure and contact properties analysis. 3.2. Microscopic test results and analysis 3.2.1. Electron microscope image processing and result analysis Fig. 8 presents SEM images showing the formation of calcium car­bonate precipitates within bio-cemented sand samples after six times treatments treated at different grouting saturation levels. Additionally, Fig. 9 displays three representative micromorphologies of calcium carbonate. The SEM images revealed a significant generation of calcium car­bonate between sand grains after the calcification of silica sand using microbial reinforcement. The calcium carbonate content exhibited a positive correlation with the increase in grouting saturation. At lower saturation levels, calcium carbonate preferentially formed at the contact points between two sand grains, while higher saturation levels resulted in substantial calcium carbonate deposition between sand grains and on the grain surfaces. The generation, distribution, and cementation effect of calcium carbonate precipitation with sand particles varied among samples with different grouting saturation levels. Higher calcium carbonate content corresponded to higher unconfined compressive strength. This phe­nomenon can be attributed to two main factors: Fig. 7. The relationship between unconfined compressive strength and calcium carbonate content. J.-P.

With the same grouting process and materials, the times of grouting directly influenced the amount of calcium carbonate precipitated. Fig. 8(b), (e), (h), (k), and (n) respectively correspond to saturation levels of 20%, 30%, 50%, 70%, and 100% magnified by 200 times, showing that higher grouting saturation led to greater calcium carbonate generation with the same times of treatment. Though the samples were treated at the same times, in lower saturation, the less volume of bacterial solution was used, the less urease existed. The calcium carbonate mass ratio must be smaller with lower saturation if the factor we compare is “times of treatment”. Therefore, the calcium carbonate mass ratio should also be compared while using the same volume of bacterial solution. Fig. 10 shows the results calculated from the data in Fig. 7. The relative volume of bacterial solution is the volume of bacterial solution used divided by the bacterial solution volume for a 100% saturation sample treated one time. It’s clear that at lower saturation (20% and 30%), the calcium car­bonate production rate was larger than that at 100% saturation, but it gradually decreased with the increase of treatment times. The calcium carbonate productivity at higher saturation (50% and 70%) was always less than that at 100% saturation. Therefore, at low saturation, the same amount of calcium carbonate can be obtained with less total bacterial solution. And when sufficient times of treatment were supplied, as shown in Fig. 8, the right column, represented by (c), (f), (i), (l), and (o), showed different levels of effective cementation, filling, and partial cementation. For samples with lower grouting saturation, the bacterial and cementing solutions primarily concentrated at particle contacts, where urea hy­drolysis reacted at the liquid bridge to generate calcium carbonate precipitation, forming a meniscus shape that contributed to strength improvement. In fully saturated conditions, where the MICP solution occupied the entire pore space, calcium carbonate crystals were not constrained in size or location, resulting in crystals on particle surfaces and within interparticle spaces. The size and location of calcium car­bonate crystal formation varied based on the distribution of solution influenced by grouting saturation conditions. Samples treated at 30% grouting saturation contained less calcium carbonate compared to samples treated at 100% saturation, indicating that the mechanical strength of the MICP-treated sample resulted from the formation of calcium carbonate precipitates at particle contact points rather than the total quantity of calcium carbonate. The lower strength of the sample with 20% grouting saturation compared to that of 30% saturation might be attributed to insufficient times of treatment, resulting in lower overall calcium carbonate precipitation and insufficient calcium carbonate content for effective cementation. (2) Crystal shape, morphology, and arrangement of calcium car­bonate: Calcium carbonate exists in three primary crystalline phases: aragonite, vaterite, and calcite. Aragonite is typically spherical or hemispherical, ranging in size from 1 to 10 mm. Vaterite appears as acicular or columnar crystals, while calcite is orthorhombic or hexahe­dral crystals and can transform between different phases under specific conditions. Fig. 9 reveals that sand particles with 30% grouting satu­ration predominantly exhibit spherical calcite crystals on their surfaces. Samples with 70% grouting saturation displayed rhomboidal calcite crystals in flower-like clusters, extending throughout the spaces and covering the particle surfaces. At 100% saturation, calcium carbonate crystals were primarily rhombohedral calcite, exhibiting regular poly­hedral shapes with little size variation. The crystal stacking was tight, leaving minimal pores between crystals, thus improving compactness and filling gaps between sand particles. 3.2.2. EDS and XRD test analysis The EDS spectra of the sand samples with various grouting saturation levels are displayed in Fig. 11. The elements present in bio-cemented silica sand primarily include chlorine, silicon, oxygen, nitrogen, car­bon, and calcium. Some EDS spectra exhibit a high content of chlorine elements due to the cementing solution being composed of calcium chloride and urea. The final step of the MICP process involves pumping the cementing solution, and the sample was not flushed with deionized water but put into the dry box directly. That results in the presence of nitrogen from urea and chlorine from calcium chloride being detected in the EDS analysis. Fig. 9.

Unsaturated soils are common in nature and saturation is a significant factor affecting the efficiency of bio-cementation. This study investigated the properties of MICP under different grouting saturation conditions. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests confirmed that biocemented sand could get higher strength under unsaturated grouting conditions with the same calcium carbonate content which helps reduce the material cost. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) test results show that at lower saturation, the size and amount of calcium carbonate crystals were insufficient but calcium carbonate mainly gathered between the particles. At higher saturation, larger calcium carbonate crystals were produced and exited in pores and on the particle surface, increasing the filling effect. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) test results show that the dominant calcium carbonate morphology detected in samples was calcite, which was the most stable one. X-ray computed tomography (CT) test results show that after cementation, the measured contact surface area became uniform and the coordination number was higher. The flow direction of bacteria and the cementing solution did not induce significant anisotropy in the cementation process. The effective cementation and content of calcium carbonate jointly influenced the improvement of soil mechanical properties.   1. Introduction Climate change is contributing to the increasing frequency of extreme weather, including drought and strong rainfall in the past thirty years, which will cause a lot of engineering and geological disasters1,2. The requirement for green engineering to reduce carbon emissions has been proposed recently. However, many of the current geotechnical materials for soil improvement, such as cement3,43,43,4 and sodium sil­icate5, are highly energy-consuming and can have a negative impact on the environment. While bio-cementation is a recent biotechnology which can be used to improve the physical and mechanical properties of soils6–8. The microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP) is consid­ered one of the most promising techniques of bio-cementation which can be used in a variety of civil engineering applications, including soil reinforcement to improve the foundations of buildings and other structures9 or to prevent landslides and embankment collapses10,11, repairing cracks in building materials, fractured rocks and mon­uments12–14, making bio-bricks15, reducing the permeability of sand­stone while mining16,17, effectively encasing contaminated sites18,19and dust suppression20. The effect of MICP is affected by the treatment process and the sur­rounding environment. A number of studies have been conducted to explore the factors affecting the efficiency of MICP21–25. These studies have provided a relatively systematic and objective understanding of the influencing factors, such as types of calcium sources26–28, calcium car­bonate content29, the concentration of the bacterial solution and its enzyme activity30, the concentration of the nutrient solution31, pH32 and temperature33. And the soil properties such as porosity34, particle size and distribution35,36, particle shape37 and saturation38 are also relevant to the performance of MICP treatment. In addition to the mechanical properties evaluated by unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests (mostly used), the microstructural characteristics have been examined by advanced techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM)39, and X-ray computed tomography (CT)40,41, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)42 and X-ray diffraction (XRD)43. Previous research found that the microstructural characteristics in bio-cemented sand treated by MICP influence its mechanical properties significantly25,38. There are two precipitation patterns discussed in previous studies. One * Corresponding author. E-mail address: abdelali.dadda@sdu.edu.cn (A. Dadda).

Conclusions A DGR for the disposal of radioactive waste, in addition to the engineered components, relies on the rock to contain and isolate the waste for very long periods of time. Rock masses at the depth of a typical DGR would in general comprise intact rock, discrete joints, and major fault zones. Major faults and discrete joints are planes of weakness in the rock mas and can be preferential pathways for radionuclide migrations. The DGR should be located away from the major faults, and waste emplacement should avoid as much as possible locations of high- intensity jointing. However, due to the extensive footprint of the DGR, undetected joints might occur in the emplacement location of a waste container. Under different external events and internal processes, the joint can shear, and potential excessive shear movements can affect the structural integrity of the container and the bentonite seals. Further­more, dilation that accompanies shear of rough joints would increase its hydraulic aperture and further enhance its potential for radionuclide transport. Therefore, for the long-term safety assessment of a DGR, the situation of an undetected joint crossing the emplacement of a waste container should be evaluated, and the implications of this situation need to be integrated in the safety assessment and design of the DGR. Mathematical models are powerful tools that could be used to evaluate the safety implications of the above scenario. In this paper, we developed and validated such a model. The model input uses two main parameters, JRC and JCS, which could be measured from inexpensive standard tests commonly conducted in rock engi­neering. The model was shown to be able to reproduce the main physical processes in two sets of laboratory tests. The first set of tests was shearing tests of jointed Freiberg granite, under constant normal loads. The model successively reproduced the increased strength and decreased dilation with increasing normal loads, and joint asperity damage induced by shear. The second set of tests is thermal shearing experiments conducted on Pocheon granite specimens with inclined fractures. The specimens were first loaded to simulate a biaxial state of stress near the slip conditions. Subsequently, the specimens were restrained by the sides and heated from the top and bottom, resulting in change of stress conditions within the fracture that trigger its slip. The model successfully predicted the temperature evolution in the speci­mens, and the thermally induced stress conditions that led to the frac­ture slip and its subsequent pronounced shear displacement. Two fracture types were considered: a smooth fracture and a rough fracture. For the smooth fracture, minimal dilation was predicted consistently with the experiment finding. For the rough fracture, also consistently with the experimental findings, more pronounced dilation and asperity damage were predicted. Damage induced stress relief, as predicted by the model, and observed from the experiment. However, the modelled stress relief does not match well in absolute value and timing with the experimental data. Experimental observations showed that damage occurred not only to the fracture asperities, but also propagated into the rock matrix in the form of microcracks and localized macrocracks. The latter process is recommended for future investigations. In addition to the effects of rock matrix damage and fracture propagation into the rock matrix, future investigations would include the effects of pore pressure (e.g. THM coupling) and the effects of different stress paths (e.g. shear under constant normal stiffness). These investigations are being planned for the next phase of DECOVALEX. The current model seems to have the potential to be further developed and validated with the new experi­mental data that would become available.

Task G of DECOVALEX-2023 focuses on THM processes of rock joints. The authors have developed a mathe­matical model that can be used to assess the scenario of thermoshearing of a joint in the vicinity of an emplaced waste container. The model is based on a macroscopic formulation within the framework of elasto- plasticity. It is verified against analytical solutions and validated against shear under constant normal load tests on jointed granite spec­imens. It is finally used to simulate thermal shearing tests of jointed granite specimens performed in the laboratory to further understand the processes that are relevant to the thermoshearing scenario considered in the safety assessment of DGRs for HLW. 2. Mathematical formulation 2.1. Viscoplastic formulation Since the 1970s, many models were developed to predict the shear strength and displacement of rock joints e.g.9–16. It is not our intention to perform an in-depth review of these models. In task G of DECOVA­LEX-202317, different joint models have been developed in order to simulate thermoshearing problems using a set of well-designed experi­mental data. There are two main types of approaches adopted in the above models. The first approach is a microscopic one, in which the asperities of the scanned surfaces (e.g. Fig. 3) of the joint are exactly represented and assumptions are made about the interaction between these asperities. In this work, we adopted the second approach, which is the macroscopic one. The model that was developed requires input data on average joint characteristics that can be obtained from basic and inexpensive characterization techniques13,19–21. The proposed model is based on the saw-tooth conceptualization (Fig. 2) of Patton9, and Plesha10 and the elasto-plastic formulation by Fig. 1. Example of geological disposal concept (from6).  Fig. 2.

According to that conceptualization, a global state of shear and normal stress τ and σ on the joint results in a local state of stress τα and σα on the joint asperity, inclined at an angle α with respect to the global shear direction. From equilibrium consideration, the local stresses are related to the global stresses as follows: σα = ( −σsinα + τcosα)cosα(1)  τα = (σsinα + τcosα)cosα(2) Joint slip starts when the friction resistance along the asperity is exceeded, ie. |τα| ≥−σαtan∅, where ∅ is the friction angle along the asperity. In the framework of elastoplasticity, a yield criterion (using tension positive convention) that defines the onset of permanent deformation of the joint is then defined as: F = |σsinα + τcosα| + ( −σsinα + τcosα)tan∅(3) By imposing the constraint that only shear stress can produce per­manent deformation16, a plastic yield potential that determines the plastic strain rate is defined as: Q = |τα| = |σsinα + τcosα|(4) The stress-strain relationship for the joint is given by: ( τσ)=[ks00kn]( u −upv −vp)(5)  Where: u, v are the total shear and normal relative displacement [m] of the joint along the global directions. up, vp are the plastic shear and normal relative displacement [m] of the joint along the global directions. ks, kn are the elastic shear and normal stiffness of the joint [Pa/m]. Using the viscoplastic formulation by Zienkiewicz and Cormeau18, the rate of plastic relative displacement is given by: ⎛⎜⎜⎝dupdtdvpdt⎞⎟⎟⎠= μ〈FF0〉⎛⎜⎜⎝∂Q∂τ∂Q∂σ⎞⎟⎟⎠= μ〈FF0〉(±cosα±sinα)(6)  Where: 〈F/F0〉= 0 if F/ F0< 0; 〈F/F0〉= F/F0 otherwise. F0 is a reference value of the yield function [Pa]. μ [1/s] is a “fluidity” constant (1/s) that determines the rate of the plastic displacement. When simulating purely plastic behaviour as in the present paper, this constant can be set equal to one. Fig. 5.

Model parameters The joint model is fully described by Eqs. (4)–(6), and the required parameters are the elastic stiffness constants ks, kn, the friction angle ϕ and the asperity angle α. We propose that the above parameters be estimated from two index parameters widely used by rock engineers, the joint roughness coefficient (JRC) and the joint compressive strength (JCS). JRC and JCS are the key parameters of the Barton-Bandis shear strength criterion 13,19–21 for rock joints: |τ| + σtan(JRCLog10(JCSσ)+ ∅)= 0(7) JRC is an index that determines the roughness of the joint walls, while JCS is indicative of the strength of the joint walls. The determi­nation of JRC, JCS could be performed by simple laboratory tests as detailed by Barton21, who also proposed empirical expressions of the elastic stiffness constants ks, kn from JRC and JCS and a determination of the friction angle ϕ using the tilt test and the Schmidt hammer test. The asperity angle, which is specific to the present model, is determined as detailed below. It is noted that the yield condition, Eq. (3), can be written as: |τ| + σ tan(α + ∅) = 0when σ sin α + τ cos α > 0(8.a) Fig. 6. Validation of the joint model with shear under constant normal stress tests for Freiberg granite.

(8) and (3), the asperity angle can be expressed as a function of JRC and JCS as: α = JRCLog10(JCSσ)(9) The surface asperities of real joints, as shown for example in Fig. 3 for a joint in Freiberg granite23, do not follow a regular pattern with a constant inclination angle α. Several orders of irregularities in the joint surface exist, each order of irregularity being activated depending on the size of the sample. Therefore, Eq. (9) is a simplified conceptualization that provides an “effective” asperity angle that depends on the scale of the joint. The following empirical expression for JRC and JCS that takes into account scale effects could be used:13,19–21. JRC = JRC0( LL0)−0.02JRC0(10)  JCS = JCS0( LL0)−0.03JCS0(11)  Where: JRC0 and JCS0 are laboratory scale values of joint roughness and compressive strength, for nominal size L0= 100 mm, and JRC and JCS are values for joint size L. 2.3. Asperity degradation During the shearing process, the joint surface can be damaged. To account for this damage, following Plesha10, we assumed that the effective asperity angle degrades according to: α = α0e−cWp(12)  where α0 is the initial effective asperity angle, that can be estimated from the initial JRC as in Eq. (9), c is an asperity degradation constant and Wp is the plastic work induced by shear, per unit area of the joint surface, and accumulated at time t: Wp =∫t0τdupdtdt(13) The constant c is dependent on the normal stress11. In this work, we use a calibration procedure using shear tests under constant normal stress in order to determine c. 2.4. Finite element implementation and verification The joint model was implemented in the commercial general- purpose finite element software COMSOL Multiphysics, Version. 6.122. The Solid Mechanics module was used and the joint was represented by spring interfaces between solid elements, with the rate of plastic relative displacement in equation6 defined as a “pre-deformation” of the inter­face. The accumulated plastic relative displacement is calculated by performing time integration of the rate (cf. Eq. 6) using the Boundary Ordinary Differentiation (ODE) module and fully coupling it to the Structural Mechanics module. The implementation was verified for the case of joint shearing under constant normal load as illustrated in Fig. 4. In this example, the jointed rock sample was sheared to a total relative shear displacement of 0.002 m (2 mm), under a constant normal stress of 1 MPa. The effective asperity angle was set to 33.4◦, the friction angle 34◦. The shear stiffness was set to 9 GPa/m. The normal stiffness was defined as a smooth step function that varies from zero, when the joint normal displacement exceeds 0.5 µm in tension, and to a stiffness equivalent to the one of the intact rock (8740 GPa/m) when the joint normal displacement exceeds 0.5 µm in compression. The above values are intentionally chosen as the same for the joint in Freiberg granite discussed next. When no joint degradation is considered, an analytical solution for the joint behaviour can be derived, as follows: τpeak= σ tan(α0 +ϕ)= 2.4 MPa. upeak= τpeak /ks = 0.00026 m (0.26 mm). up =u-upeak= 0.00174 m (1.74 mm). vp =uptan(α) = 0.001147 m(1.147 mm). Wp = τpeakup. The finite element results are compared to the analytical solution in Fig. 5, showing good albeit not perfect agreement. This is because the Fig. 7.

Displacement and stress conditions from the numerical simulation are not uniform along the fracture. Fig. 5 shows comparison between the value of the relevant variables averaged over the fracture versus the point-value given by the analytical solution. The agreement is deemed acceptable and provides confidence in the implementation of the model in the COMSOL software. 3. Simulation of joint shear under constant normal stress Here, we validate the proposed joint model with direct shear tests under constant normal stress conducted at the rock mechanics labora­tory of the TU Bergakademie Freiberg, Germany23. The tests were con­ducted with a shear box device specially designed at the laboratory24 on jointed granite and basalt samples. We will focus here on the jointed granite sample. The test configuration is similar to the one for the verification problem shown in Fig. 4b. The jointed granite sample was sheared under constant normal load of successively 1 MPa, 2.5 MPa, 5 MPa and 7.5 MPa. After the end of each shearing process under a normal load, the joint surfaces were reset to the initial position before testing to the higher normal load. The in­vestigators23 performed scanning of the joint surface before the start of the test series (Fig. 3) and after the last shearing test and found evidence of damage of the joint surfaces. The finite element model for the experiment is similar to the one for the verification problem shown in Fig. 4. The input data used are given in Table 1. The modelling results are compared to the experimental data in Fig. 6. It is shown that good agreement was obtained between the modelling and the experimental results:  • The shear strength as indicated by the stress-displacement curve increases with the normal stress (Fig. 6.a) Fig. 8.

With higher normal stress, dilatancy decreases due to asperity degradation that occurred during the previous shearing phases at lower normal stress. The asperity angle is dependent on the accumulated plastic work as described in Eq. (12). In the numerical simulation, at a certain normal stress level, an initial asperity angle is defined, and then degrades according to Eq. (12). The final value obtained at a normal stress level is used as an initial value in the subsequent analysis at the higher normal stress level. • At the start of shearing at normal stress of 1 MPa, the JRC was esti­mated at 16. Consistently with the experimental observation, the model predicts damage of the joint surfaces. The model indicates that JRC decreases to a value of 9.5 at the end of shearing under a normal stress of 7.5 MPa  • As a result of joint asperity degradation, dilation is smaller for tests at higher normal stress (Fig. 6.b). The modelled dilation is consistent with the experimental data for this finding. However, there is some quantitative discrepancy since the model does not account for the initial compression of the joint due to microcracks closing at the beginning of the shearing process.  • Most of the asperity degradation occurred during the first test at 1 MPa normal stress. This is indicated by a pronounced softening behaviour (stress reduction) as shown in Fig. 6.a. For subsequent higher normal stress, the joint exhibited some hardening behaviour followed by a nearly perfectly plastic behaviour. The modelling re­sults are consistent with the experimental data for this softening- hardening behaviour, except for the highest normal stress of 7.5 MPa, where continuous hardening was found. 4. Thermally induced joint shear 4.1. Overview of the experimental procedure Laboratory experiments to simulate the scenario illustrated in Fig. 1. b were performed on jointed cubes of Pocheon granite of South Korea25. The Pocheon granite contains 35.7 % quartz, 35.9 % orthoclase/pla­gioclase mix, 25.8 % microline and 2.6 % biotite and its thermal and mechanical properties are indicated in Table 2. The three 100×100×100 mm3 cubes being tested are intersected with fractures oriented at approximately 42◦with the horizontal direction. Three types of fractures were created:  • a saw-cut fracture (SF), prepared by cutting through the intact cube with a saw;  • a laser marking fracture (LF), prepared by saw-cutting an intact cube, then shaping the roughness of the top surface by a laser marking machine;  • a tensile splitting fracture (TF), created by splitting the intact cube by tension. For the LF specimen, there is a strong mismatch between the top and the bottom fracture walls, with estimated JRC of approximately 4 for the top wall and 2 for the bottom wall. We will focus on specimens SF and TF, with matched fracture walls. The SF fracture is smooth, with JRC for bottom and top surfaces estimated respectively at 0.62 and 0.69, while the TF fracture is relatively rough, with JRC values estimated at respectively 12.53 for the top surface, and 12.48 for the bottom surface Fig. 9.

The jointed rock specimens were tested in a biaxial apparatus in two phases (Fig. 8): • First it was compressed with a horizontal stress larger than the ver­tical stress. The vertical stress was 3 MPa, while the horizontal stress was 9 and 24.61 MPa for the SF and TF samples, respectively (Fig. 8. a)  • Then the horizontal faces are constrained to restrain horizontal displacement, followed by heating from the top and bottom surfaces (Fig. 8.a). Heating would increase the horizontal stress, while the vertical stress remains constant, eventually resulting in slip failure along the fracture when the normal and shear stress on the fracture reach the failure envelope of the fracture (Fig. 8.b). This change in boundary conditions allows higher development of thermal stresses to mimic a bounding scenario for the field conditions as illustrated in Fig. 1.b. • During the heating phase, temperatures were measured with ther­mometers emplaced on the outside faces of the cubic sample, shear relative displacements along the fracture were measured by both the clip-on displacement transducers and by camera recordings, and the pressure developed along the restrained vertical faces was recorded by pressure sensors. Acoustic emission was also recorded with AE sensors (Fig. 8.c) 4.2. Modelling procedure and results The input parameters for the modelling are shown in Table 2. Except for the thermal expansion coefficient, all experimentally determined parameters25 were directly used as model input. The input value of the coefficient of linear thermal expansion had to be increased from the experimental value, since the latter was obtained from laboratory tests on intact Pocheon granite sample. It is noticed however25 that the pro­cess of fracture creation induced microcracks, and even macrocracks (for the TF) and would lead to an increase in the thermal expansion coefficient. Therefore, for modelling purposes we increase that coeffi­cient by approximately 20 % and 40 % for the SF and TF, respectively. The finite element model for the thermoshearing experiment showing the sequence, the boundary and initial conditions is illustrated in Fig. 9. In the first phase a steady-state mechanical analysis under a biaxial loading condition was performed. In the second stage, a coupled Thermal-Mechanical transient analysis was performed. In that second phase, the stress distribution calculated from the first phase was input as initial stresses and displacements were re-initialized to zero. The hori­zontal load was removed and replaced by rollers to prevent normal displacements. Heating was then applied from the top and bottom. Only heat conduction was considered in the thermal process. The initial temperature in the cube and the external temperature were set at 25 ◦C. The temperature in the heaters at the top and bottom of the specimen was raised to 150 ◦C within 1000 s. There is heat loss through the heating plates in contact with the specimen. Instead of considering the plates explicitly, we assumed that heat fluxes from the heater into the rock specimen could be represented as:  Qheater= h(T-Theater)                                                                       (14) where h is a heat transfer coefficient through the plates, calibrated to 45 W/m2/K and 30 W/m2/K for the bottom and the top surfaces, respectively and Theater is the heater temperature, being raised from 25 ◦C to 150 ◦C in 900 s The front and back faces are in contact with the open air and heat loss from these faces due to natural convection are simulated as:  Qconv= h(T-Text)                                                                            (15) where T is the temperature on the face inside the cube, Text = 25 ◦C is the external temperature and h is the heat transfer coefficient, assumed Fig. 11.

The fracture is assumed to be a thin resisting layer, since as observed during the experiment, the fracture surfaces are not in perfect contact, especially for the TF specimen. The heat transfer flux across the fracture is modelled as:  Q=-(Tu-Td)/R                                                                               (16) Where Tu and Td are, respectively, the temperatures on the upper and lower surfaces of the fracture; and R is the heat flux resistance, cali­brated to 0.15 K.m2/W. Typical output for the temperature field is shown in Fig. 10. The temperature field clearly shows the effect of natural convection at the front and back faces, resulting in lower temperatures on these faces as compared to the interior of the specimen. The temperature field also shows the effects of thermal resistance of the fracture, due to imperfect match between the upper and lower surfaces. For simplification we assumed that the temperature fields would be the same for the SF and TF specimens. The experimental temperature discussed in25 is reported solely for the SF specimen, implicitly assuming that for the TF specimen, the same temperature field would prevail. The calculated temperature evolution is compared to the measured evolution at different thermometers (Fig. 8.c) positioned on the front face of the specimen in Fig. 11. The comparison is reasonably good for all positions, considering the uncertainties related to the complex con­ditions of heat transfer from the heaters, which were not included in the model. The modelling results show that temperatures near the heaters (T2, T4 and T5) are higher than temperatures in the horizontal mid- plane (T3 and T6). It could also be seen that temperatures at T4 and T6 are different, although these sensors are at the same distance from the heaters. This is due to the effect of the fracture. By including a thin resistive layer, this effect is captured by the model. Fig. 12.a shows the modelled horizontal stress distribution, in the vertical mid-plane of the cubic sample, resulting from the biaxial state of stress σmin on the horizontal faces and σmax on the vertical faces. Due to the presence of the fracture, the stress distribution within the sample is not uniform. This stress distribution was used as the initial stress for the subsequent thermo-mechanical analysis. Before heating started, σmax was removed, and the vertical faces were restrained against normal displacement. This operation would result in a stress relaxation due to some sliding along the fracture, as indicated in Fig. 12.b. Subsequent heating would result in an increase in stresses in the sample, as indicated in Fig. 12.c. The normal and shear stresses along the joint increase simultaneously due to heating, leading to its eventual shear failure. For the SF specimen, the modelling results for joint displacement and thermally induced horizontal stress increment for the SF specimen are shown in Fig. 13 and compared with the experimental data. Consistently with the experimental observations, as temperature increases the hori­zontal stress increases on the restrained vertical faces of the sample (Fig. 13a). The incremental stress at equilibrium from the model com­pares reasonably well with the measured value. However, the model indicates an earlier stress increase as compared to the experimental values. In order to obtain a better agreement of the transient stress evolution, a recalibration of the thermal analysis might be necessary, that would require a more accurate representation of the heating plates and the loading plates. The shear displacement (Fig. 13.b) predicted by the model compares well in trend and absolute values with the recorded data. Shear displacement is minimal up to 1200 s of heating, exhibiting a rigid-plastic behaviour. The normal and shear stress in the joint increase simultaneously due to heating, eventually reaching the yield conditions as conceptualized in Fig. 7.b and shown in Fig. 13.c. For the SF spec­imen, modelled joint dilation is very small of the order of 1–2 µm as also recorded from the experiment. For the TF specimen, the modelling results also compare well with the experimental values for shear displacements (Fig. 14.a) as measured by the transducer and camera recordings at most positions. For dilation, the modelled results also compared well with the camera recordings. The measurement of dilation from the sensor (Fig. 14.b) is however unreliable, since it was reported that it experienced thermal expansion during the heating process. As compared to the SF specimen, shear displacement is larger, mainly due to the larger asperity degradation, as discussed below. The fracture dilation is also larger due to the more pronounced roughness of the fracture surface. The modelled horizontal stress, consistently with the experimental measurement, shows first an increase followed by a decrease (Fig. 15). However, the timing and absolute values of the modelled stress in­crements do not match well with the experimental values. The modelled stress decrease is due to strain softening triggered by the asperity damage that reduces the value of the effective asperity angle, as shown in Fig. 15. This is consistent with the post-test observations by Zhuang et al20. who reported sheared off particles from the fracture walls. In addition, these authors also reported microcracks and localized macro­cracks forming from the main fracture. Crack propagation into the rock matrix will make the overall strain softening more pronounced and this phenomenon is not included in the current model, where the rock matrix is assumed to be linear elastic.

Joints are omnipresent in rock masses and are planes of weakness in the host rock. When deep geological repositories (DGRs) for radioactive waste are being considered in areas where rock joints are present, the joints could be preferential pathways for radionuclide migration. Therefore, their THM behaviour must be better understood to assess the safety of the DGR. Under different possible internal and external perturbations, a joint can move by shear and dilation. If the joint crosses the emplacement area of a waste container, the heat generated from the waste can itself induce shearing of the joint. Excessive shear movement can in turn lead to failure of the container, resulting in earlier release of radionuclides. Furthermore, dilation that might accompany shear, results in an increase in the joint aperture creating a faster flow path for radionuclide transport. Mathematical models are important tools that need to be developed and employed, in order to assess joint shear and dilation under different loading conditions, such as the heat generated from the emplaced waste. The authors have developed such a mathematical model based on a macroscopic formulation within the framework of elasto-plasticity. It is verified against analytical solutions and validated against shear under constant normal load tests and thermal shearing tests of joints in granite.   1. Introduction Discontinuities, which we call joints or fractures in this work, constitute planes of weakness and hydraulic conduits in rock masses and need special attention in the design and construction of underground structures. The joint behaviour under different thermal, hydraulic and mechanical processes and their combination needs to be understood for the safe and optimal operation of activities such as carbon geo­sequestration, geothermal energy extraction, and shale gas production1–5. The focus of this paper is on geological disposal of radioactive waste being considered in many countries which consists of emplacing the waste in a repository at depths of hundreds of metres in a suitable rock formation. A deep geological repository (DGR) relies on a multiple barrier system to contain the waste and isolate it from the surface environment for periods of hundreds of thousands to millions of years6. The main components of the multiple barrier system are the waste container, the bentonite sealing system that surrounds the container in the emplacement room and the host rock formation (Fig. 1a). The primary type of waste considered for deep geological disposal is high-level radioactive waste, such as used fuel from nuclear power plants. High-level waste (HLW) generates heat and would substantially raise the ambient temperature in the DGR and host rock for tens of thousands of years. This heat results in complex multiphysical processes that perturb the Thermal (T)-Mechanical (M)- Hydraulic (H)- Chemical (C) regime in the multiple barrier system and impact its long-term performance 7,8. In this paper, we focus on a scenario when a joint in­tersects the emplacement area of a container, as schematically illus­trated in Fig. 1b. Several external events such as earthquakes or water recharge from future deglaciation, and internal processes such as the heat generated from the waste, can potentially trigger joint movement. Excessive shear slip is the most damaging joint movement since it can affect the structural integrity of the waste container, potentially result­ing in earlier release of radionuclides. Shearing is usually accompanied by dilation resulting in an increase in the joint aperture and perme­ability, further enhancing its ability to transport radionuclides. * Corresponding author.

NYS_DEC_Oil__Gas__and_Other_Regulated_Wells_Overview.pdf,"media/NYS_DEC_Oil__Gas__and_Other_Regulated_Wells_Overview.pdf:```Oil, Gas, and Other Regulated Wells Overview  General Description The Division of Mineral Resources maintains a data management system on wells regulated under the Oil, Gas and Solution Mining Law (OGSML). More than 75,000 wells have been drilled in New York for oil, natural gas, solution salt mining, stratigraphic, injection, geothermal, brine disposal, and underground gas storage. Electronic records exist for roughly 40,000 wells, of which about 12,000 are active. All of this data is created and maintained for the use of the Division of Mineral Resources and is covered by a disclaimer regarding its use.  Data Collection Methodology Regulated operators provide information to the Division of Mineral Resources through various regulatory filings. Most of the information in this dataset comes from the Well Completion Report, the organization report for registered companies, and the application to drill, deepen, plug back, or convert a well. This information is used to track the history of a wellbore from its inception to final plugging, and it helps the Division of Mineral Resources regulate the oil and gas industry in New York State. Some well data is given confidentiality status according to Section 23-0313 of the Oil, Gas and Solution Mining Law and Section 87-2 of the New York State Public Officers Law. Please see http://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/1605.html for more information on confidential well data.  Production data is acquired from the annual well reports operators submit to the Division of Mineral Resources in the spring of each year. This data is kept confidential for six months and is released to the division’s public webpage in early July. Production information is not contained in this dataset but is available from the link contained in the individual well’s record.  Statistical and Analytic Issues The DEC database (http://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/1603.html) is updated nightly to provide access to information from new permits and completion reports as they are submitted to the Division of Mineral Resources.  Limitations of Data Use This data has not been field verified, but approximate locations are expected to be within 100 meters of the actual well location. The data should not be used for determining precise distances to buildings, property boundaries or other features. It is most useful for determining the general locations of wells. Coordinate locations are approximate. The latitude and longitude are in the NAD83 datum. The dataset reflects the status of all wells in the Oil and Gas Wells database as of the previous business day. Wells currently afforded a confidential status are included, but all confidential data is redacted. ```"

The values of the compressive strength are presented as a normalized form over the initial values of each set where no chemical mass removal takes place. The results of the two sets of bio-precipitated specimens with different initial dissolvable contents i.e., ks = 0.166 and 0.153 are summarized in Fig. 14a and 14b, respectively, while Fig. 14c shows the result of natural calcarenite samples from Southern Italy under various degrees of min­eral mass removal, data fitted from Ref. 7. The calcarenite samples used in the experiments7 are sedimentary soft rocks with fragments bonded to each other by calcium carbonate crystals forming a coating around and inside the pores (see the inset in Fig. 14c), which is similar to the granular structure of MICP-treated sands. Therefore, the results of the three cases show the same trend in terms of the gradual degradation of the compressive strength as the mass removal progresses. A linear fitting against the experimental results according to the chemical degradation mechanism in Ref. 14 shows the slopes (corresponding to the chemical degradation coefficient βq) in the two bio-cemented cases, ks = 0.166 and ks = 0.153, equal to 1.3 and 1.2, with the R-square value of 0.724 and 0.911, respectively. The fitting curve slope for the calcarenite samples7 is 2.6 (R-square value 0.742), significantly steeper that of the bio-treated specimens. This discrepancy suggests that the MICP-treated samples are less sensitive to the reactive environment; in other words, they appear to be “twice resilient” to environmental acidification in terms of the compressive strength, compared to the natural carbonate-rich rocks. Fig. 15 depicts how the Young’s modulus of the three sets of speci­mens degrades with a decrease of the calcite content as the chemical mass removal progresses. The material weakening in terms of the elastic modulus due to mineral mass loss is evident for both the bio-cemented sands and the calcarenite specimens.

The values of the slope of the fitting curves of bio-cemented samples ks = 0.166 and ks = 0.153 and the calcarenite specimens are 1.3, 1.2 and 5.4, respectively, which correspond to the chemo-elasticity coefficient βE in E = E0(1 −βEξ) as described in Ref. 14. The R-square values for the three sets of specimens are 0.475, 0.896 and 0.814, respectively. The comparison suggests that the MICP-treated specimens can be much less sensitive to mineral mass loss in the elastic regime compared to the calcarenite specimens. The small difference in the slope of the fitting curves (i.e., the effect of mineral mass loss on the elastic modulus) of the two groups of bio-cemented sands also implies that the experimental procedure adopted for fabricating the MICP-treated specimens is robust. Based on the kinetics of the dissolution of calcium carbonate given by Ref. 34, the rate of the dissolution of CaCO3 follows a power law func­tion of the local hydrogen concentration CH+, in the form of ˙ξ = βH+ ×(CH+)k′. The exponent k′ is a constant within the range of 0.5–1.0 35. To obtain the coefficients of βH+ and k′ for our model which characterize the relationship between the overall mass removal rate and local hydrogen concentration, the experimental results on MICP-treated samples from four imposed pH environments (pH = 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 and 7.0) were selected for calibration. The power law fitting is depicted in Fig. 16, with the units for the mass removal rate ˙ξ and the hydrogen concentration CH+ being h−1 and M (molar concentration), respectively. The fitting with the experimental results of bio-cemented samples yields (with R-square value 0.999) the values for βH+ and k′ being 0.047 and 0.69, respectively, falling within the suggested range of natural rocks35. The initial porosity and permeability of the bio-cemented samples used for fitting are 0.285 and 3.10×10−13 m2, respectively. 4.2. Derivation of coupling parameters For deriving the coupling parameters, numerical experiments simu­lating the laboratory uniaxial compression tests on dissolvable samples exposed evenly to an acid solution under a low loading speed (i.e., to simulate a two-way reactive coupled chemo-mechanical scenario) were carried out. The bio-treated materials for the numerical tests are assigned with a given dissolvable content, ks = 0.156. Coefficients used for the numerical experiment are taken from the laboratory experi­mental results in the above-described analysis, which are βq = βE = 1.3, k′ = 0.69, βH+ = 0.047. The reactive environment is set at pH 2.0 to be consistent with the laboratory experimental setting to ensure a two-way chemo-mechanical coupling, unless it is a subject of parametric studies.

First, we present a validation case where the numerical results from the simulated chemo-mechanical experiment are calibrated against the laboratory experimental results of bio-cemented samples under a com­bined mechanical (axial compression) and environmental (immersed in acidified fluids) loads. The numerical setup for the uniaxial compression tests is shown in the inset of Fig. 17. The mechanical boundary condi­tions imposed on the specimen consist of an axial compression with a constant loading rate (speed control mode) at the top and zero axial displacement at the bottom. A uniform acidic (or neutral, for the base case of pure water) environment of constant pH value is applied on all the boundaries of the specimen to simulate a full immersing condition. In the current study, we apply axial loading at a low speed (0.02 mm/ min) to ensure an observable degree of calcite dissolution and a coupled process between chemical dissolution and mechanical deformation. The beginning portion of the stress-strain curves in Fig. 12 is linearly treated for numerical fitting. The initial Young’s modulus (640 MPa) and yield limit (3.51 MPa) remain the same for the two cases, which are extracted from the experimental data of the non-reactive samples (represented by the black hollow squares in Fig. 17). The experimental data of the MICP- cemented samples subject to acidic environment is represented by the blue hollow triangles in Fig. 17. The blue and black curves represent the numerical results simulating the bio-cemented samples deforming under axial loading in the presence of acid environment and pure water, respectively. Under acidic environment, the irreversible portion of the deformation is linked to an enhancement of SSA, which is represented by a coupling coefficient η describing the effect of mechanical damage on the process of chemical dissolution. The value of coefficient η = 3 × 104 is obtained by fitting the stress-strain curve and the onset of yielding from the laboratory experiments. As demonstrated in Fig. 17, the nu­merical fitting shows good agreement with the post-yield ductile behaviour obtained in the uniaxial tests and can capture the yield threshold points for pure water as well as acidic environment. Next, we present a series of numerical experiments predicting the behaviour of the bio-treated specimens for chemical environment of a variable pH value and for a variable loading rate, using the calibrated numerical setup shown in Fig. 17. In all the numerical tests, the specimens are immersed in a stable acid environment of a constant pH and subject to uniaxial compression loading simultaneously. The time scale defined by the compression speed is comparable to the time scale defined by the damage-enhanced chemical reactions. Fig. 18a depicts the material behaviour of the bio-cemented samples exposed to three acidic environments characterized by pH value equal to 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, respectively. Other input parameters and material properties remain the same as what we used in Section 4.1. A few notable features are observed in the numerical results of Fig. 18a in terms of what role the acid in­tensity plays in the coupled chemo-mechanical process as of the above- described uniaxial compressive loading tests. First, little difference ex­ists between the three curves in the beginning portion of deformation due to the fact that limited mass content is removed from the solid matrix within a short period of reaction. As the deformation continues, the specimen subject to the most intense acid environment (pH = 1.0) is the fastest in reaching the yield threshold with the lowest peak strength and exhibiting a significant strain softening in the post-peak regime, i.e., the most “efficient” chemical softening among the three cases. For the case of pH = 2.0, the yielding occurs at an elevated axial strain but reaching an increased peak strength, with the post-peak strain softening much flattened. In the case of pH = 3.0, the strain softening effect be­comes insignificant, which is similar to what is observed in the case of pure water (as shown in Fig. 17), indicating the characteristic time scale Fig. 17. Quantitative validation of the reactive chemo-mechanical model with uniaxial compression tests on specimens emersed in acidic aqueous environ­ment to achieve chemo-mechanical coupling during deformation. The inset shows a schematic of the numerical setup. Fig. 18.

Fig. 18b shows a comparison between the numerical test results of three cases featuring the loading speed 0.01 mm/min, 0.02 mm/min and 0.04 mm/min, respectively. The pH value of the chemical envi­ronment is set as 2.0 and all the other parameters are the same as in Fig. 18a. The stress-strain curves exhibit a similar trend that the initial linear portion representing the elastic regime is insensitive to the varying loading rate. However, the lowest loading rate case of 0.01 mm/ min reaches yield at an axial strain (approximately 0.5 %) slightly smaller than the other two cases, with a most prominent strain softening effect shown by the stress-strain relationship. We note here that a lower loading rate introduces a longer reactive time during deformation, and that the three cases of loading speed at 0.01, 0.02 and 0.04 mm/min reach the peak strength of the specimen upon a total reaction time of 50 mins, 27 mins and 14 mins, respectively. We hence conclude that a fast loading rate (0.04 mm/min) results in a higher peak strength while a low loading rate (0.01 mm/min) leads to a lower peak strength due to a more adequate reaction time (a larger total mass removal) during the elastic and the strain hardening regime prior to reaching the peak point. Chemical softening post peak is significant for all the three loading cases, but the highest loading rate of 0.04 mm/min here appears to exhibit a shielding effect for the reaction-deformation coupling - through a distanted mechanically-defined and chemically-defined time scale in the system. 5. Conclusions We present in this contribution an experimental investigation on the role of calcite content on the mechanical and hydraulic properties of bio- treated sands and how resilient MICP-treated samples are in response to a combined mechanical and chemical load. Bio-cemented rock-like materials with controlled matrix structure and mineral compositions were fabricated through the MICP approach. A series of experimental calibrations were performed to reveal the correlation between the me­chanical and hydrological properties of the fabricated specimens with various calcite content and the progress of mass removal. A set of key coefficients that are essential to the coupling of the multi-physical pro­cesses were derived based on our recently proposed reactive-chemo- hydro-mechanical framework and its numerical platform described in Ref. 14. The main findings of this study include the following:  (1) The Kozeny-Carman equation is shown to provide a rational prediction of the relationship between porosity and permeability for MICP-treated rock-like materials with varying the internal calcite content.  (2) Mechanical properties of bio-cemented materials change with the calcite content as reflected by the compression strength and Young’s modulus. A ductilization effect is observed, indicated by the transition in failure mode in the post-yield stage, that the post-yield stress-strain curve exhibits a more ductile behaviour with a decreased amount of internal calcium carbonate serving as granular bonding.  (3) For the bio-treated specimens under compressive loading subject to chemical dissolution simultaneously, we validate and calibrate an enhanced degradation on the material properties with labo­ratory experiments. This chemically enhanced degradation is linked to an accelerated mass removal rate enabled by an increased specific surface area per unit volume, as predicted in the coupled reactive chemo-mechanical model.  (4) A set of coupling coefficients are derived from an integration of the laboratory obtained data and the numerical experiments simulating bio-cemented materials under loading in reactive environment, including the degradation coefficients for Young’s modulus and the compression strength, the parameters in the kinetic equation for the dissolution of calcium carbonate and the coefficient η representing the effect of mechanical damage enhancement on the process of chemical dissolution. The results suggest that the bio-cemented samples appear to be more resilient than natural calcarenites in response to mechanical loads in reactive environment.  (5) Additionally, the numerical studies using a setup simulating the uniaxial compression tests on specimens immersed in acidic environment demonstrate a shielding effect of the damage- reaction coupling with an elevated loading rate.

Incubation of bacteria, Sporosarcina Pasteurii, for Microbially Induced Carbonate Precipitation A commonly used bacteria, Sporosarcina Pasteurii (ATCC 11859), was selected for its highly active urease enzyme in a variety of chemical envi­ronment. To prepare the bacteria solution with the required cell concentration, a growth medium (ammonium-yeast extract medium, ATCC 1376) was firstly produced which is composed of 0.13 mol L−1 tris buffer solution (pH = 9.0), 10 g L−1 (NH4)2SO4, and 20 g L−1 yeast extract as suggested by the ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). Each component was prepared separately and mixed after autoclaving at 120 ℃ for 20 min. Specifically, per 1 L liquid medium, 20.0 g of yeast extract and 10.0 g (NH4)2SO4 were dissolved into deionized (DI) water of 250 ml, respectively. Tris base of 15.748 g was subsequently dissolved into 500 ml DI water and the pH value of the solution was adjusted to 9.0 by dropping hydrochloric acid solution. After the autoclaving procedure, the growth medium was obtained by mixing in a clean bench environment. Microorganisms in mother cell solution (OD600 0.45) from the same generation were used to prevent any difference in bacteria feature in various generations. Mother cell solution was then transferred into the growth medium at a volume ratio of 1 % (v/v), followed by the growth at 30 ◦C in an incubator at a shaking speed of 200 rpm. The Optical Density of the mixture was recorded by spectrophotometry (JingKe Industrial, Model V-2600) at a wavelength of 600 nm (OD600) for estimating the growth state of bacteria in the aqueous environment. The growth curve over time is depicted in X. Tang and M. Hu                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ```"

Specifically, the elasto-viscoplastic model14 addresses the laboratory-observed ductile behaviour that soft rocks or rock-like ma­terials exhibit under stress when immersed in reactive aqueous envi­ronment, based on the central postulate that an additional specific surface area of the total fluid-solid interface can be generated through a proxy of micro-fracturation leading to an enhanced dissolution and/or precipitation10,12,15,16. The model in Ref. 13 is an extension that takes further into account the effect of the evolving hydraulic field on the local acid delivery upon initiation enabled by chemical erosion. Accurate measurement of the key coupling parameters becomes essential in terms of achieving the predictive power of the proposed constitutive models and a more accurate understanding of the interaction between the physico-chemical processes and the mechanical evolution, as well as the contribution of each physics or chemistry feeding back or forward the others within the system. However, there is an outstanding lack of experimental studies in the current literature looking into such coupled processes, due to the following reasons. First, the development of coupled reactive chemo-mechanics con­cerning a deforming geomaterial and its surrounding environment is relatively recent. Second, experimental calibration is challenging because the rate of certain chemical reactions in natural rocks is low which would require a substantially long time for the experiment, sometimes not realistic under laboratory conditions. Meanwhile, most constitutive models developed so far are based on an idealization of natural soft rocks or stiff soils by e.g. assuming homogeneity and no previous loading history, while the samples collected from the field for laboratory tests are normally not. For example, the calcarenites used in the experimental study7 are representative of sedimentary soft highly porous rocks, consisting of a network of calcite grains with irregular shapes that are randomly connected by calcareous bridges17. Both the grains and the bonds can react to an acidic environment, but the mineral dissolution from the grains and that from the intergranular bonds (which occurs more easily) contribute differently to the overall degra­dation of the matrix18. However, in the laboratory the progress of the chemical reaction is measured by the total dissolved calcite content, for which the source of the mineral mass removal, either from the grains or the bonds, can hardly be distinguished. A geomaterial, natural or man-made, with distinct mineral distribution in bonding structure, e.g. only the bonds are dissolvable, is hence ideal for a more quantitative evaluation and calibration of the constitutive models. In this sense, bio-cemented sands, an emerging engineered rock-like material for geotechnical purposes, can be an excellent candidate for its more uniform structure and a tunable calcite content. Microbially Induced Carbonate Precipitation (MICP), as the most common method for the bio-cementation process, is adopted here. The method of MICP utilizes the metabolic activity of microorganisms to produce CO2−3 which reacts with free Ca2+ to create precipitation of CaCO3. After the bio-cementation treatment through MICP, sand particles transform into a rock-like specimen bonded by the precipitated calcite crystals, which can reach a substantial mechanical strength of up to 12 MPa in Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) as reported in the literature19–21, similar to a soft carbonate rock. The mineral composition of MICP-treated sands can be made simple and the content of precipitated calcium carbonate bonding the sand grains can be precisely identified by measuring the difference in sample weight22,23. The total reaction time of the MICP procedure varies based on the designed calcite content, typically ranging from a few hours to several days21, and is hence practical and effective for sample preparation in the laboratory. The present laboratory-based study utilises MICP-treated sands as an example for dissolvable rocks and investigates how this novel type of rock-like specimens behave in chemically reactive environment, which has not been previously reported in the literature to the best of our knowledge. The effect of acid-fluid-rock interaction on matrix defor­mation and flow properties is illustrated and a set of coupling co­efficients are derived. The experiments were designed based on the reactive chemo-mechanical framework proposed in Ref. 14 by consid­ering the evolving mechanical and hydraulic properties as a function of the progress of calcite mass removal from the solid matrix. The structure of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is a detailed description of the experimental setup on the fabrication of the bio-specimens made of MICP-treated sands and the laboratory procedure of the mechanical and hydraulic tests. Section 3 describes the phenomenological observations from a poromechanical point of view illustrating the evolution of porosity and permeability with the varying content of calcium carbonate precipitation and the results of coupled chemo-mechanical tests on the MICP-treated specimens. Section 4 presents a calibration against the reactive chemo-mechanical model in Ref. 14 and derivation of the key coupling parameters. Additional numerical tests simulating the uniaxial test of specimens in acidic environment are also included to predict the behaviour of bio-cemented sands with varying acid intensity and loading rates. The present study is expected to generate impact in en­gineering adaptation to climate change and provide guidance for the design of emerging bio-inspired geotechnical approaches. 2. Material and methods The feedback mechanism in the coupled chemo-hydro-mechanical system of MICP-treated sands in a reactive environment is summarised in Fig. 1, encompassing four key elements that are potentially tightly coupled during evolution: (1) the constitutive relations of the solid matrix, which is dependent on the progress of total mass removal (here, mineral dissolution), resulting in time-dependent behaviour of reactive chemo-elasto-plasticity; (2) fluid flow in the porous medium, propelled by local hydraulic gradients and alteration in the matrix permeability; (3) chemical dissolution, the rate of which depends on the local acid concentration as well as the specific surface area (SSA) linking to the irreversible micro-cracking process; and (4) ion transport, characterized Fig. 1.

As formulated in our recently proposed models13,14, the involved physical, chemical and mechanical fields are coupled by a set of control parameters, namely the mass removal index (ξ) and the stain invariant (̂ε) underlining the irreversible generation of micro-cracks inside the process zone, feeding back and forward to the coupled system. The models in Ref. 13,14 in principle apply to both natural and man-made geomaterials as long as they react to chemical environment with a certain degree of mass removal. In this contribution, we employ bio-cemented silica sands, a rock-like material that exhibits considerable mechanical strength due to the internal bonding of grains by calcium carbonate from the MICP process, to calibrate the developed models under controlled laboratory conditions. Bio-cementation has emerged in recent years as a promising alternative for traditional methods in many applications in geo-engineering, for its zero-carbon emission, environ­ment- and ecology- friendly features. A prominent advantage of using MICP-treated silica sands in this study is that the mineral composition, particularly the content of the dissolvable substances in these bio-cemented samples, can be controlled with a better precision, rendering the laboratory calibration for the mass-bassed reactive chemo-hydro-mechanical model a simpler but more accurate process. Also, the results from the experiment conducted in this study can be used for comparison with the counterpart of natural carbonate rocks in the coming future. In this section, we introduce the procedure of specimen fabrication and the method how the experimental investigations were carried out on bio-cemented specimens under chemically reactive environment, to calibrate the key coefficients in the coupled process of mechanical deformation, chemical dissolution and the development of the internal fluid flow field. 2.1. Specimen preparation The specimens we use for the controlled chemical degradation tests are bio-cemented sands from MICP with a given particle size distribution (PSD). The sand used in experiments is silica sand produced in Zhuhai, Guangdong province of mainland China. Sand particles are cemented by calcite precipitation from the microbially manipulated processes via a devised apparatus (introduced in Section 2.2) providing intergranular bonding and sufficient initial strength prior to the chemical erosion tests. The advantage of choosing bio-cemented specimens relies on that the amount and the location of the dissolvable mineral (i.e., calcite) are more controllable with higher precision, compared to natural carbonate- rich rocks. The PSD curve of the sand group used for fabricating the specimens is depicted in Fig. 2, measured by dynamic image analysis through the QicPic apparatus (Brand Sympatec GmbH). The particle size of the sand ranges from 0.063 mm to 0.9 mm with d20 = 0.11 mm, d50 = 0.16 mm and d90 = 0.51 mm, obtained from QicPic. Maximum and minimum void ratios (e) are measured for the determination of the relative density of samples after the consolidation in the reactive mould, with emax and emin equal to 1.068 and 0.482, respectively. The size of the specimens in terms of the diameter and height is controlled by packing firmly the sand particles using a fixed steel mould as shown in Fig. 2c. To ensure an initial uniformly distributed density profile along the spec­imen, a layering approach is used separating the sand into five layers for packing with a fixed height and sand weight. Two relative density (RD) cases were adopted by controlling the weight of the sand layer during the preparation. Two groups of sand were selected for fabricating the specimens, with 300 g (e = 0.651) and 315 g (e = 0.734), representing RD of 0.569 and 0.710, respectively. 2.2. Biological cementation MICP is so far considered as one of the most promising bio-treated methods for turning sand particles into a rock-like material. The incu­bated bacteria (Sporosarcina Pasteurii, ATCC 11859) acts as a catalyst hydrolysing the urea to increase the pH value of the aqueous environ­ment, inducing calcite precipitation when a source of calcium is pre­sent24. Details on how we grew bacteria are presented in the Appendix. A sketch of the experimental setup for the bio-cementation treatment is shown in Fig. 3, through which the compacted sand particles held in a rigid cell go through sequential injections of DI water, bacteria and reactive solutions, from the bottom (through a steel porous base) to the top. Silica sand particles with a specific relative density are placed in the rigid cell with a thin porous stone (5 mm thickness) at the bottom and a thicker one (15 mm thickness) at the top. The dimension of the sand cylinders is designed as 100 mm in height and 50 mm in diameter. An exhaust system is incorporated for removal of the air bubbles inside the connection tubes before the sequential injections. The bio-cementation procedure started with an injection of 200 ml of DI water into the dry sand particles in the cell to achieve saturation, followed by an injection of 200 ml bacterial solution. After 10 min of Fig. 2. (a) Particle size distribution curve of silica sand for preparation of samples. (b) Minimum void ratio tests in a shaking container.

For each injec­tion, the fluid volume used is larger than the total pore space so that an entire updating of the solution contained in the cell is ensured. To achieve an overall effective reaction and to control the final precipita­tion content in the specimen, the injection of reactive solutions was divided several times whose retention time of each reactive solution is determined based on the chemical concentration19. The chemical con­centration of urea and that of calcium chloride used in all the experi­ments are 0.25 M considering the reaction time and the achievable strength of the final products. Reactive chemicals were prepared by dissolving 27.75 g anhydrous calcium chloride (Sigma brand, purity ≥97 %) and 15 g urea pellets (Sigma brand, purity ≥99.5 %) into 1 litre DI water plus 10 ml growth medium. Injection of the chemical solutions was performed every 6 h19 until reaching an expected calcite mass content. Note that the injections were conducted by a peristaltic pump fixed at a constant flow rate (approximately 8 ml/min), and hence the total time for each injection (200 ml) is much shorter than the main bio-cementation process (6 h) indicating a neglectable influence of in­jection time on the mass content of calcium carbonate generated by MICP. In addition to the injection flow rate, the optical density of bacteria, molar concentration of reactive chemicals, sample size, and ambient temperature (25 ℃) were controlled at laboratory conditions to prevent any random influence on the final products. The only influence factor in the total calcite content in the treated specimen after the MICP process depends on the injection frequency, ranging from 5 to 25 times in preparation of one bio-specimen, for both two RD cases (300 g and 315 g sand matrix indicating the initial RD of 0.569 and 0.710 respectively). 2.3. Hydraulic and mechanical tests for bio-cemented samples 2.3.1. Porosity and permeability After the above-described bio-treatment and before the removal from the rigid cell for strength tests, the permeability of the cemented sample was measured according to Darcy’s law by recording the flow rate of the peristaltic pump and the pore pressure of the inlet and outlet respec­tively through a high-accuracy pressure transducer (Omega, PX409–030GUSBH). Subsequently, the bio-cemented rock-like samples were taken out from the mould and kept in an oven (set at 80 ℃) for 48 h. The weight of calcium carbonate generated during the MICP process was obtained by measuring the mass difference of dry samples before and after the treatment. In this step, the pore space after the re­action and the porosity of samples can be estimated by calculating the volume of calcium carbonate for a given compound density (2.71 g/ cm3). The Kozeny-Carman law is adopted to characterize the relation­ship between porosity and permeability, corresponding to the change of content of calcium carbonate. The rationality of such an approach for describing the coupled chemo-hydro-mechanical process in carbonate rock formations will also be examined with the experimental data in this study. 2.3.2. Characterization of mechanical properties of bio-cemented samples with variable calcite content To characterize the relationship between the content of calcium carbonate in the specimen and the associated mechanical properties including elasticity modulus and yield limit, uniaxial compression tests are performed for all samples. A loading system is utilized for testing with a constant loading rate (1.0 mm/min) for all samples. This exper­iment can be viewed as a one-way characterization during which pre­treated samples are tested with chemical and mechanical processes loading sequentially. 2.3.3. Bio-cemented rock-like samples subject to a combined action of acid dissolution and axial compression When dissolvable rock-like solids are subject to mechanical loading and chemical reaction (here, mineral dissolution) simultaneously, the induced irreversible deformation increases the total specific surface area of the solid-fluid interface per unit volume leading to an enhanced meso- scale reaction rate as illustrated by Tang and Hu13. Meanwhile, the enhanced chemical mass removal process accelerates material degra­dation resulting in more intense irreversible deformation/damage, feeding back to the deformation-dependent reaction mechanism, form­ing a two-way coupled chemo-mechanics. In this contribution, we aim to derive the key coupling coefficients for bio-cemented silica sands un­dergoing such two-way coupled processes using a coupled experimental setup. The laboratory calibration on two-way coupled chemo-mechanical feedback consists of two steps. First, the rate of mineral dissolution (˙ξ) is tested by immersing the MICP-treated samples in an acid solution. A fraction of the samples weighing approximately 15 g (deviation within 0.5 g) was immersed in a 100 ml acid solution for durations ranging from half an hour to six hours during which the acidity of aqueous environment was monitored (pH fluctuation within 0.1). Three cases are Fig. 3. Schematic diagram showing an experimental framework transforming loose particles into a cemented sample via microbiologically induced calcite pre­cipitation. Chemical solutions, a peristaltic pump, a reaction cell and pressure meters are incorporated to fabricate biologically treated sands for the required calcite content. X. Tang and M.

After a certain duration, the acidic fluid was replaced by a sodium hydroxide solution (pH 12.0) to consume up the remaining acids and terminate the disso­lution. After another hour of retention, samples were flushed thoroughly with DI water followed by oven drying. The percentage of matrix mass removal by mineral dissolution is calculated by measuring the reduction of calcium carbonate weight through Sartorius Secura® Analytical Balance (Readability: 0.1 mg), and the reaction rate is obtained by a linear fitting against datasets. The subsequent step is to conduct uniaxial compression tests on the MICP-treated samples subject to concomitant loading and mineral mass removal due to an imposed acidic environment. Samples for compres­sion tests remain the same in terms of the calcite content and sand matrix as what we use for dissolution tests to ensure the rationality to adopt the ˙ξ tested in the former. In our practice, we apply an acidic environment to promote a considerable mass removal content during the loading process with a compression speed of 0.02 mm/min in the axial according to the reactive speed acquired in dissolution tests. Two-way coupled uniaxial compression details are described as fol­lowed. The samples adopted for two-way coupled experiments call for considerable calcium carbonate content, stiffness and strength to exhibit an observable chemo-mechanical coupled effect. After the initial contact (upon loading pressure equals 10 N) between the loading frame and cylinder samples which lie in a transparent container (15 cm in diameter and height respectively), 1500 ml of acid fluid will be poured inside to create an acid environment. The acidity of the immersed fluid is continuously measured by a pH meter (Mettler Toledo) to record the mild change of acid degree resulting from the assumption of hydrogen in the reaction. In addition to the monitoring of stress and strain values during the loading, a camera is set in front of the loading frame to capture the failure mode of compressed samples. 3. Experimental results 3.1. Relationship of porosity and permeability for bio-cemented materials with variable content of calcium carbonate After multiple cycles of injection of reactive chemicals into the samples, calcite precipitates on the surface of the loose sand particles bonding them together providing the end products with certain strength and compliance. A comparison between a sand particle before and after the MICP treatment is illustrated in Fig. 4a and Fig. 4b, where scanning electron microscope (SEM) visualization shows that bio-induced mineral precipitation forms an additional thick layer surrounding individual sand particles. To identify the components of the mass precipitated in the samples, standard energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was employed for element characterization after the MICP treatment and the results are shown in Fig. 5. Four elements are identified, namely Calcite (Ca), Silica (Si), Oxygen (O) and Carbon (C). The mapping demonstrates that calcite (in pink color in Fig. 5) dominates the precipitation of mineral mass adhering to the surface of sand particles (in blue color in Fig. 5). With a slight zoom-out, as shown in the SEM photo in Fig. 4c, we see that the precipitated calcium carbonate occupies nearly the entire pore space of the sand matrix transforming an assembly of silica sand particles into a well-cemented rock-like material of a much lower permeability. Parameters describing two groups of MICP-treated samples, including the dimensions, the total mass of calcite precipitation, dissolvable content, porosity and permeability are listed in Table 1. Group A and Group B are distinguished by the relative density. For both groups, as the injection frequency increases, more calcite mass is precipitated occupying the pore space and resulting in a decreased porosity. The total volume of the pore space is calculated by subtracting the volume of the silica sand and the volume of the generated calcium carbonate from the volume of the cylinder. To prevent any error from the slight deviation of sample size that occurred in the pre-treatment stage, i.e. the compaction of the specimen, for calculating the porosity, we re-measured the sample sizes after removal from the rigid cell to eliminate the slight deviation between the designed cell size and the dimensions of cemented specimen in experiments associated with Fig. 4.

With internal pore space gradually filled by the precipitated calcium carbonate, the bulk permeability the sand columns undergo a significant decrease, by roughly one order of magnitude comparing the perme­ability of the bio-treated end-product with that of the sand assembly prior to any induced calcite precipitation, as shown for both groups in Table 1. In terms of measuring transport properties of a reactive porous medium, the evolution of bulk permeability is normally linked to the evolution of porosity following a certain pattern, e.g. the Kozeny- Carman equation. The premise for the Kozeny-Carman relationship to hold is, however, the assumption that the change in the topology of the sand assembly (and hence of the pore structure) is little, which is not necessarily the case for sand columns undergoing MICP treatment as the effective grain size and tortuosity are continuously altered as the calcite precipitates onto the grain surface. In what follows, we show quantita­tively how the permeability-porosity relationship in our MICP experi­ments deviates from the Kozeny-Carman relationship. Fig. 6 presents the distribution of measured permeability versus porosity according to changes in calcite content. With the increment of porosity which indicates the loss of calcium carbonate inside materials, experimental results (marked by open circles) show that permeability undergoes significant development in agreement with the theoretical trend as predicted by the Kozeny-Carman relationship. Here, we follow the expression of κ = Φ2sϕ3D2p180(1−ϕ)225,26 for the empirical κ −ϕ line in which Dp denotes the diameter of sand grains in the unit of meter which nor­mally takes the value of d10 in terms of the effective particle size, i.e., the diameter of the particles of which 10 % of the soil is finer27,28. Φs is a dimensionless parameter representing the sphericity of the particles. Dp and Φs take the values of 0.85 × 10−5m and 0.7 respectively of initial sand particles according to the QicPic. An R-square of 0.960 fitting the experimental results with the empirical model proves the appropriate use of the Kozeny-Carman equation to characterize the evolution of porosity and permeability corresponding to the change of internal cal­cium carbonate. For highly dense sand cylinders in which initial pore space is limited, the change of calcium carbonate accounts for a small portion of the composition with the dissolvable content ks lower than 0.2.

Fig. 7 describes contrasting stress-strain behaviours by uniaxial compression tests for two bio-cemented samples with different calcite contents, represented by the dissolvable content ks = 0.099, 0.125 and 0.166. For the rock-like specimen with a high calcite content, i.e. the case of ks = 0.166, as the axial loading goes on, the failure occurred abruptly at the maximum axial stress, accompanied by a significant sudden release of energy. Powder-like materials were produced by se­vere friction at the fracture surfaces, which is shown in the inset of Fig. 7. Shear failure took place with a relatively even failure surface cutting through the specimen at about 60 degrees from the horizontal plane. Such a classical failure mode indicates uniform internal calcite cementation during the bio-treatment phase. Notably, the specimen in the case of ks = 0.166 reaches compressive strength of more than 7 MPa in the UCS test, followed almost immediately by the above-described abrupt shear failure at an axial strain of 1.06 %. In contrast, the spec­imen of a low calcite content ks = 0.099 displays a more ductile stress- strain behaviour in the UCS test (the post-peak regime ranges 1~1.63 % axial strain) and a much lower compressive strength (roughly 1 MPa), as shown in Fig. 7. This switch in the observed failure mode is enabled by a significant reduction in the mass fraction of the precipitated cal­cium carbonate. In what follows, we investigate the effect of calcite content on the mechanical properties in terms of the magnitude of the UCS and the Young’s modulus. The Young’s modulus was determined by measuring the slope of the initial linear portion of the stress-strain curve. Two groups of bio-cemented specimens with silica sand mass 315 g and 300 g were tested to illustrate the effect of induced mineral mass accretion on improving strength properties of a geomaterial. For both sand groups, with an increase in the calcite content, the UCS of cemented samples exhibits an overall rise, from the loose matrix of sand particles without any calcite precipitation to the well-cemented cylindrical specimens. A similar trend is seen in the development of the Young’s modulus when the precipitated amount of calcium carbonate onto the sand matrix ex­ceeds a certain value, for example 18.5 g calcite mass for the 315 g case (RD=0.710). With a relatively low calcite content, the cemented matrix generally shows a ductile behaviour as indicated in the stress-strain curve by the uniaxial compression test (see Fig. 7), and the elastic modulus is in the below 0.1 GPa range (UCS < 0.5 MPa) for samples with less than 15 g of calcite content. With a larger amount of calcite precipitation occupying the internal pore space, the sample becomes significantly stiffer, resulting in the effect of calcite content on increasing the Young’s modulus more pronounced, as shown in Fig. 8b. The resulting mechanical properties are mildly affected by the dif­ference in the sand content (corresponding to two representative rela­tive densities of the silica sand matrix used for the bio-treatment). At a low value of calcite content, there is bare difference between the two sand groups in terms of both the UCS magnitude and the Young’s modulus due to weak bonding between particles (calcite precipitation sparsely distributed on the surface of sand particles), as shown in Fig. 9a. Within the calcite content range higher than 15 g, it is observed that the effect of increased calcite content in the group of looser contact sand particles (the 300 g group, RD=0.569) on improving the compressive strength is slightly more significant. As for the stiffness, the 300 g sand group appears to have a higher value of the Young’s modulus than the 315 g sand group with the same amount of total calcite precipitation. The reason that the sand group of lower relative density is more sensitive in terms of mechanical properties to calcite mass addition lies in a more effective inter-particle bonding (see Fig. 9b) generated in the sand ma­trix with looser contact under well-packed condition31. 3.3. Uniaxial compression tests on bio-cemented samples in acidic environment Before the coupled chemo-mechanical experiments with bio- cemented samples undergoing compressive loading in an acidic envi­ronment, we carried out experiments for measuring the reaction rates for the bio-cemented samples subject to solutions with different acidity. Considering that the mass removal rate is influenced by the specific surface area of the interface between the solid matrix and the acidic aqueous environment per unit volume linking further to the internal porous structure, the bio-cemented samples used for the dissolution tests are maintained the same porosity and calcite content as the cylinders used for the coupled uniaxial compression tests. In this series of tests, the sand weight, dissolvable content ks, porosity and permeability of the material are 315 g, 0.141, 0.285 and 3.10×10−13m2, respectively.  Fig. 10 depicts the evolution of the progress of mass removal versus reaction time in three acidic solutions, which reveals an overall linearly increasing trend as a result of the controlled stable acid intensity of chemical solutions and a negligible change in the specific surface area. The mass removal progress index ξ denotes the percentage of the mass of the dissolved calcium carbonate divided by the total calcium carbonate mass contained in the cemented samples. The dissolution rates for the three acid solutions, pH = 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0, are obtained by measuring the slopes of linear fitting curves as 0.197 %, 0.039 % and 0.011 % in unit h−1, respectively. After 6 h of exposure, around 1 % of calcium carbonate dissolves for the pH 2.0 case due to the relatively low porosity of the selected sample. To match the time scale defined by the loading speed of the uniaxial compression tests, an acid environment of pH 2.0 was selected for the coupled reactive chemo-mechanical tests detailed as follows. Fig. 11 illustrates the experimental setup that we used for the two- way coupled uniaxial compression tests involving several mechanisms including mineral dissolution, matrix deformation and mechanical Fig. 7.

As the in­ternal content of calcium carbonate decreases, the failure mode of carbonate material goes through a transition from brittle to ductile failure. X. Tang and M.

The pH values and fluid temperature throughout the experiments were recorded to ensure good control of the reactive environment, i.e. the pH value kept at 2.0–2.1 and temperature kept around 25 ◦C. A sequence of photos shown in Fig. 11d records the process of bio-cemented samples immersed in an acid fluid being loaded at 0.02 mm/min until failure. A shear failure mode is observed after 5300 s of the compression (approximate 1.5 h) with the failure surface at approximate 55 degrees from the horizontal plane spanning across the samples. To eliminate the influence of saturation on the compression strength in the analysis of acid effect, bio-cemented samples with the same carbonate ratio were tested in pure water in comparison with the reactive case (see Fig. 12). First of all, in the early stage of the coupled reaction, no significant difference can be observed between the two cases due to very little calcite mass removal from the solid skeleton within a short period. Upon 40 min of reaction (εa = 0.008), a contin­uous decrease in the stiffness emerges to be observable in the presence of ongoing mineral dissolution. For the acid-treated sample, the compres­sive strength of the specimen reaches 3.26 MPa, which decreases by 7 % in comparison with the case immersed in pure water (3.51 MPa). This pronounced effect of chemical degradation in terms of material strength loss can be related to the progress of mineral mass removal14. According to the above-described dissolution rate determination, with the same duration roughly 0.2 % of calcite would be dissolved in the same acidic environment, which can not pose such level of degradation on the compressive strength if the effect of damage is not taken into account. This indicates that an enhanced mass removal rate is achieved during the matrix deformation, supporting the hypothesis that the portion of irreversible deformation or damage increases the total specific surface area and hence the reaction sites per unit volume. A key parameter in the two-way reactive chemo-mechanical model is thereby the coefficient Fig. 8.

In the following section, we introduce a numerical scheme based on the platform developed in our earlier work14, which we employ to derive the micro-cracking enhancement coefficient by fitting the obtained experi­mental data. 4. Inversion for the coupling coefficients In this section, we utilise our experimental results to calibrate the model proposed in Ref. 14 and invert for a set of coefficients that are key to the mutual dependence of the multi-physics processes. We note that due to laboratory limitations in terms of e.g. the adjustable range of the loading speed, the allowable reaction duration and the control precision of the composition of samples, the following experimental exploration intends to provide a preliminary calibration for the proposed model, which is however an important first step. In what follows, based on the numerical platform of the reactive Chemo-Hydro-Mechanics14 that we implemented in the MOOSE environment32,33, an open-source finite element simulator, we invert with varying loading speeds and acidity environments the key coupling coefficients that are essential to the proposed model. The numerical framework that includes a set of Kernels and AuxKernels describing comprehensive processes of the coupled chemo-hydro-mechanics in a saturated elasto-viscoplastic porous solid undergoing (irreversible) deformation is detailed in Ref. 14. Coupling of four fields is considered in the multiphysics framework, including solid deformation, fluid flow, chemical reaction (calcite dissolution) and so­lute transport with a set of parameters feeding back/forwards driving the overall behaviour of the system. The feedback loop is schematically illustrated in Fig. 13, while in what follows we focus on assessing the chemical degradation effect on the mechanical properties of specimens under laboratory conditions in both plastic and elastic regimes, as well as deriving the key coupling parameters. 4.1. Fitting for the coefficients of degradation caused by internal mass loss We first fit the experimental results of bio-cemented samples with variable calcite content for the degradation coefficients, which will be compared with the counterpart for calcarenite samples from literature.  Fig. 14 presents the correlation between the uniaxial compressive strength and the mass removal index ξ for two sets of fabricated bio- cemented sands and a set of calcarenite samples from the rock labora­tory weathering experiment in Ref. 7.

The Multiphysics-involved process for each application is complex and an optimised control calls for a better understanding on the coupling mechanism of the chemical, hydraulic and mechanical fields. This laboratory-based study aims to provide a quantitative calibration and derivation of the key coupling parameters accommodating our recently proposed framework of reactive chemo-mechanics, using a bio-cemented rock-like material as a representative for dissolvable rocks. The advantage of bio-cemented specimens (here by microbially induced carbonate precipitation) over natural rocks lies in their more uniform grain-bond structure and laboratory tunable calcite content. An experimental setup is introduced for investi­gating the role of calcite content on the mechanical and hydraulic properties of bio-cemented silica sands, fol­lowed by uniaxial tests on the bio-cemented specimens immersed in acidic environment to allow a reactive chemo-mechanical setting. Our results show that bio-cemented samples appear to be more “resilient” to an acidified aqueous environment in terms of less strength degradation compared to natural carbonate-rich rocks. Ductile failure mode is observed in the bio-cemented specimens within a certain range of the calcium carbonate content and a brittle-to-ductile transition in the failure mode occurs when the calcite content in the specimen decreases. With the calibrated model and the derived coupling parameters, we further illustrate an example of numerical prediction on the mechanical response of bio-cemented specimens under varying acidic environments and loading rates.   1. Introduction How stressed porous geomaterials behave in a reactive environment is a non-trivial time-dependent problem that fascinates modern-day geo- scientists and geo-engineers. Many new geo-energy technologies involve the application of chemical stimulation where internal deterioration occurs in the geomaterial or the geological formation in the affected zone due to progressive chemical erosion that depends on the mineral mass dissolution. For instance, a prominent application is an engineered chemical softening for the deep, tight, low-permeability hydrocarbon bearing formations, which in combination with the development of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling allows tapping into the so- called unconventional energy resources recovery1,2. The major concern associated with enhanced hydraulic fracturing is however that it may leave chemical footprint to the environment and result in unnecessary expenses and reduced productivity3,4 as well as induced seismicity5. An optimised control of the process calls for a better un­derstanding of the Multiphysics involved acid-water-rock interaction. In the geo-environmental domain, coupled chemo-hydro-mechanical processes have attracted much attention under the scope of Climate Change Mitigation, driven towards a safe and sound geological seques­tration of excess CO2 from the atmosphere6. Another concern regarding the rapid change of climate is a potential enhancement of coastal erosion in carbonate-rich areas due to ocean acidification, i.e., the excess CO2 dissolving into the aquasphere elevating the acidity of seawater. Long-term chemical dissolution of grains and intergranular bonds together with the cyclic action of waves poses threats on the stability of vulnerable regions along the coastline7. This acidification introduced into the hydrologic cycle has also been considered as a possible envi­ronmental effect causing the increasing trend of catastrophic tailings * Corresponding author.

As the strain rate increased, the interior pores were significantly compressed, resulting in an optimization impact more than the degradation effect. After the critical strain rate, there was an obvious cracking effect and the dynamic strength decreased. The critical strain rate in this paper was defined as the strain rate corresponding to the peak stress. The critical strain rate with confining pressure was discovered to show a U-shaped distribution and to be the lowest under 6 MPa confining pressure. Because the 6 MPa confining pressure had maximum compressed the coal before impact, the critical strain rate appeared first after impact. In Table 4, the failure model after 5 impact cycles under 2 MPa confining pressure was chosen to investigate its association with strain rate. When the strain rate was 133 s−1, the surface of the coal showed microcracking but remained intact. It was apparent that as the strain rate increased, so did the degree of damage. The failure mode displayed mixed damage caused by tension and splitting and the particle size of the crushed coal particles generated decreased. It’s worth noticing that the splitting and spalling was concentrated on the half of the coal closest to the incident bar, whereas the opposite half was barely spalled. When the strain rate reached 207 s−1, the coal exhibited mostly spalling fracture. 3.2.2. Variation of the failure strain and elastic modulus after 5 impacts Failure strain is one of the basic mechanical property parameters and is applied to characterize the final deformation of coal. In Fig. 13, as the strain rate increased, so did the failure strain, indicating that the degree of deformation of coal increased. At the same strain rate, the failure strain was maximum under 2 MPa, followed by 10 MPa and the mini­mum under 6 MPa and 8 MPa confining pressure. The elastic modulus is a measurement of an object’s ability to resist Fig. 17. Cumulative porosity curve of the coal sample.

The mixture modulus was utilized here, as shown in Eq. (6). The ratio of stress difference to strain difference at 0.4 and 0.6 times the peak stress was used31. E = σ2 −σ1ε2 −ε1(6) As shown in Fig. 14, the elastic modulus tended to decrease with the strain rate. The tiny fissures in the coal were fractured by stress con­centration at the initial microcracks under impact load. And the for­mation of tiny fractures diminished the capacity and percentage of the coal structure to transfer load, weakening material characteristics and lowering the elastic modulus. Furthermore, at the same strain rate, the elastic modulus reached its maximum under 6 MPa and 8 MPa confining pressures and this trend was opposed to the failure strain. This suggested that the elastic modulus had a negative relationship with the failure strain. The larger the strain rate, the smaller the elastic modulus, the lower the stiffness of the material and the larger the elastic deformation of the coal. 3.3. Variation of the pore structure development after 5 impacts 3.3.1. Variation of the T2 spectrogram after 5 impacts According to nuclear magnetic theory38, the arithmetic expression between the relaxation time T2 and the pore radius r inside the coal is as Eq. (7). 1T2= ρ SV = ρ Fsr(7)  Where, ρrepresent the relaxation strength of the pore surface; S, V, and rrepresent the surface area, volume and radius of pore respectively; Fsrepresents the geometric shape factor;. In this paper, the T2 value was utilized to characterize the pore dis­tribution. The micropore is represented by a spectrum with a T2 relax­ation time value less than 10 ms, the mesopore is represented by a spectrum with a T2 value between [10 ms, 100 ms] and the macropore or fissure is represented by a spectrum with a T2 value more than 100 ms.39,40 The three peak values P1, P2 and P3 corresponded to the three pore groups and the results showed that the micropore occupied the dominant position, while the number of mesopore and macropore was minor. Fig. 15(a) depicts the variation of T2 spectra with strain rate for water-saturated coal samples under 2 MPa confining pressure. When the strain rate increased, P1 decreased and moved to the right, but P2 began growing. The results demonstrated that strain rate facilitated the for­mation and penetration of micropore groups to generate larger-scale pores or fractures. This conclusion has been confirmed by scholars,25, 26 but the previous researches were limited to this, not in-depth. In Fig. 15(b), when the total amplitude of micropore, mesopore and macropore groups was studied, it was found that when the strain rate increased, the micropore group decreased while the mesopore group increased. However, the macropore group showed a fluctuating ten­dency rather than an increase or reduction. It was noteworthy that when the macropore group decreased, the micropore group increased, and when the macropore group increased, the microporous group decreased. It demonstrated a negative correlation between the micropore and the macropore group. 3.3.2. Variation of T2 spectral area after 5 impacts In this paper, micropores were defined as adsorption pores in the pore structure for storing adsorptive gas that cannot flow freely and mesopores and macropores were defined as seepage pore for the through-transportation of free-flowing gas41. To effectively avoid the difference in primary pores, Eq. (8) was used to calculate the evolution of pore structure after impact. RSj = ΔSjSjini= Sjfin −SjiniSjini(8)  Where, RSj is the variation rate of adsorption or seepage pore spectral area; Sjfin is the final T2 spectral area after impact; Sjini is the initial T2 spectral area; Sa is the adsorption pore; Ss is the seepage pore. As shown in Fig. 16 (a), the adsorption pores after impact were much higher than those before impact, but the RSa showed the W-type decrease with the strain rate. When the loading rate was elevated, there was insufficient time to assure full micropore growth. Moreover, the increasing strain rate accelerated the development, expansion and penetration of adsorption pores and promoted the formation of seepage pores. However, it can be seen in Fig. 16 (b) that the RSs showed the predominant M-type trend with the strain rate, with an overall range of 0.65–2.0. Because when the adsorption pores developed into the seepage pores, the mesopores expanded and penetrated to the macro­pore, eventually forming macroscopic fissures, causing the signal amplitude to fluctuate within the range. 3.3.3. Variation of effective porosity after 5 impacts The effective porosity was employed to explore the capacity of pore connection and gas to flow.42,43 As shown in Fig. 17, the T2 spectrum area of coal under the saturated water state was all pores space, that under dry conditions was residual porosity. Therefore, as shown in Eq. (9), the difference between the total porosity and residual porosity was effective porosity. ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩φr = φt ×BVIBVI + FFIφe = φt ×FFIBVI + FFIφt = φr + φe(9)  Where, BVI and FFI are bound and free fluid coefficient respectively. φr, φt and φe are residual porosity, total porosity and effective porosity respectively. The effective porosity range after 5 impact cycles under confining pressure was tested to be 9.6–17%, which was much higher than 5% before impact. The reservoir rock’s effective porosity was estimated to be relatively stable at 10–15% and excellent at 15–20%. It indicated that the cyclic impact played a significant role in the modification of coal porosity. The representative effective porosity data can be seen in Fig. 20.

(10). Rφe = φeφt× 100%(10)  Where: Rφe is the ratio of effective porosity to total porosity. As shown in Fig. 18(a), the Rφe showed a tendency to decrease after the increase with the strain rate. Therefore, the critical strain rate was defined as the strain rate that corresponded to the maximum of Rφeunder confining pressures. It could be shown that as the confining pressure increased, the critical strain rate showed the U-shaped distribution and the lowest was under 6 MPa. This law was the same as the critical strain rate of compressive strength. This showed that the peak stress of the coal was highest after cyclic impact under 6 MPa and it was more difficult to destroy. The Rφemaximum value of 0.74 was also found under 6 MPa confining pressure. Therefore, the 6 MPa was more than enough to ensure the development and penetration of pore space inside the coal. In addition, as shown in Fig. 18 (b), the RSa under different confining pressure increased significantly after the critical strain rate. At this point, the mesopore developed into larger pores and the micropore was well developed to cause the adsorption pores to increase, resulting in the residual porosity increasing. Therefore, the compressive strength of coal at this critical strain rate was considered to be the highest and the degree of penetration was also the highest. 3.4. Variation of fractal dimension According to,43,44 the horizontal tangent line along the maximum value of the cumulative porosity curve of the centrifugal state coal sample is intersected with the cumulative porosity curve of the saturated state coal sample and the relaxation time corresponding to the vertical foot obtained by making a plumb line at the intersection point is the T2cutoff value. The T2cutoff value can be used by dividing the multiscale pore structure into seepage pore structure (T2 >T2cutoff) and adsorption pore structure (T2 <T2cutoff). Zhou et al., 45 introduced the parameter DNMRM, the fractal dimension of the flowable fluid space as Eq. (11), to characterize the complexity of macropore or microfracture structures. ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩Sv =( PcPc min)Ds−3Pc =⃒⃒⃒⃒2σ cos θFsρ⃒⃒⃒⃒1T2Pc min =⃒⃒⃒⃒2σ cos θFsρ⃒⃒⃒⃒1T2 max(11)  Where, Pc and Pc min are the capillary pressures corresponding to arbi­trary pore size r and maximum pore size rmax respectively; σ is the fluid surface tension; θ is the contact angle; Sv is the ratio of cumulative porosity in the pre-T2i segment to total porosity in the NMR relaxation spectrum; Ds is the fractal dimension; T2 max is the maximum relaxation time in the T2 spectrum. Through logarithmic processing of Eq. (11), the fractal equation of pore structure of coal samples can be obtained as Eq. (12). ln(Sv) = (3 −Di)ln(T2) + (Di −3)ln(T2 max)(12) The effective fractal dimension range of porous rock media is (2−3). It is believed that the closer the fractal dimension value is to 2, the higher the rock homogeneity and the closer it is to 3, the more complicated the pore structure and the more significant the pore surface roughness.46,47 According to the fractal geometry theory48, free pores of coal have superior fractal properties than closed pores. Therefore, in this paper, the fractal properties of free pores in various metamorphic coals were primarily investigated and the orthogonal distance regression approach was utilized to determine Ds, as shown in Fig. 19. In Fig. 20, Ds showed a trend of decreasing and then increasing with the strain rate, opposite to Rφe. The dynamic load penetrated the pores and fractures before to the critical strain rate, smoothing the pore sur­face and increasing the degree of gas flow, but after that, the converse is true. 3.5. Variation of fracture surface roughness The morphology of rock fracture surfaces is instrumental in explaining the dynamic fracture mechanism of rocks and fracture sur­face roughness is widely used to examine the flow behavior of CBM in rock fracture. The previous researched could not incorporate a com­bined investigation of the fracture surface and internal pore structure. Therefore, to explore the strain rate effect on the fracture properties of coal, the fracture surfaces were scanned using the 3D profile scanner (KEYENCE VR-5000). The roughness variation of the fracture surface of the coal is assessed by the 3D surface roughness parameter Sa3D and the calculation equation as Eq. (13)31. Sa3D =(1/NM) ∑Ni=1∑Mj=1⃒⃒Zij⃒⃒(13)  Where, Z is the distance between the contour point of the coal surface area and the reference plane; N, M is the collection point perpendicular to two directions in the measurement area. As shown in Table 6, initial photos and 3D scanning images of representative coal fracture surfaces were analyzed and displayed. Based on these data, section roughness Sa3D was calculated through Eq. (13). In Fig. 21, the pattern of Sa3D with strain rate is comparable to Rφe, displaying an increasing and subsequently decreasing tendency, in contrast to Ds, nevertheless, Sa3D decreased with strain rate under 10 MPa confining pressure, as did Ds. To explore the change of pore structure, Sa3D, Ds and Rφe under different confining pressures were chosen for comparison. In Fig. 22, the increasing and decreasing trends of Ds and Rφe were inversely propor­tional, with the same turning points. Sa3D and Ds also showed opposing patterns, but showed the same patterns under 10 MPa confining Fig. 21. Variation rate of Sa3D with the strain rate as the independent variable.  P. Li et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ```"

Therefore, seepage fractal dimension based on the NMR theory could be used to define the variation of pore structure of coal. Before the critical strain rate, the fracture of the coal was mainly intergranular fracture, Sa3D increased, a huge number of cracks formed on the fracture surface. At this time, micropores were developing through, the pore roughness became smaller, Ds decreased, gas mobility enhanced and Rφe also increased. The loading rate penetrated the pore channels, relieving the squeezing effect on the pores and accelerating the intermolecular collisions, resulting in gas molecule slip flow at the pore walls. The Klinken-berg effect dominated gas diffusion, leading in gas slippage flow49. After the critical strain rate, the majority of the energy in the process of rock breaking is applied to smooth the fracture surface and form main cracks rather than to create microscopic cracks. The loading rates led to extrusion and slip between fracture surfaces, as well as the grains wearing each other, resulting in a considerable quantity of debris formation. At this time, the fracture of the coal also began to convert to transgranular fracture, resulting in the Sa3D tending to decrease and more energy to be used to smooth the fracture surface, resulting in inadequate growth of tiny pores, pore roughness increasing, Ds increasing, and Rφe decreasing. The gas diffusion was dominated by Knudsen diffusion flow pattern. Adsorption deformation and surface adsorption layer thickness both increased. However, under 10 MPa confining pressure, the accu­mulated energy of high confining pressure resulted in serious damage. The excessive confining pressure promoted the formation of pore Fig. 22.

Mechanism and engineering significance As shown in Fig. 23, multistage dynamic fatigue loading leads to the realization of developed and complicated fracture networks. Single loading causes the main fracture to form and cyclic loading causes the stress concentration at the crack tip to evolve. When the crack network is extended, fissure network systems are formed and the pores for coal gas adsorption to open. The gas within the wellbore pressure differential and the desorption space flows to the seepage of the fracture network con­nected, creating favorable conditions for gas. In this paper, the strain rate effect was studied by combining the microscopic pore structure with macroscopic fracture surface, which rarely appeared in previous studies. The results showed that the dy­namic load promoted micropore propagation and increased fracture complexity. When the strain rate exceed critical value, the dynamic properties of coal deteriorated obviously and the compressive strength decreased significantly. Moreover, less energy is required to form microcracks and more energy is used to smooth the fracture surface and create larger macro fractures. Therefore, low detonation rate cyclic blasting can ensure a wide impact radiation area, resulting in developed regional fractures and effective extraction of a single wellbore. High detonation rate cyclic blasting can achieve quick development of the main fracture and lower wellbore deployment. The results could provide theoretical support for the rational design of drilling spacing, explosive distribution and medicament settings based on dynamic cracking range to achieve maximum cracking range and efficiency. 4. Conclusions The SHPB and NMR were employed to investigate the petrophysical characteristics and porosity evolution of coal after cyclic impact fracturing under 0–10 MPa confining pressure. Furthermore, the 3D profile scanner was utilized to assess fracture surfaces to study the damage mechanism from a multiscale perspective. The conclusions were summarized as follows,  (1) There existed the critical impact number, confining pressure and strain rate that significantly affected the dynamic mechanical properties of coal. The compressive strength increased first and subsequently decreased, reaching the maximum at the critical value before degradation became apparent. The dynamic load diminished the deformation resistance of the coal, reduced the elastic modulus and increased the failure strain.  (2) The loading rate promoted the expansion of pore structure and the transformation of micropores into mesopores and macro­pores. The dynamic impact elevated the effective porosity from 5% to 9.6–17%. There was also the critical strain rate under 2–10 MPa confining pressure, the same value affecting compressive strength, that altered the ratio of effective porosity to total porosity from increasing to decreasing.  (3) Before the critical strain rate, the coal fracture was mostly intergranular, and gas diffusion was dominated by the Klinken- berg effect. Beyond the critical value, more energy was consumed to develop fracture surface in the rock breaking pro­cess. The fracture was predominantly transgranular, with the Knudsen diffusion flow pattern dominating gas diffusion.  (4) The higher the compressive strength of coal, the more dynamic load could guarantee the development and penetration of mi­cropores. However, only the impact radiation zone with a restricted crushing range can form, rendering the development of macroscopic extension fractures impossible. The fracture exten­sion length could guarantee that the borehole deployment is minimized, saving engineering costs. Fig. 23. Schematic of multistage dynamic fracturing.

The study of the mechanical characteristics of coal is now well- developed, with19–22 researching the static and dynamic mechanical behavior. However, there have been few investigations on petrophysical characteristics and porosity evolution of cyclic fracturing coal under the triaxial impact test. The previous research does not reveal the principle in a systematic manner, but it does serve as a guide for our investigation. In recent years,23 used X-ray micro CT images to study the compressive fatigue fracture progression of cubic concrete. Zhang et al., 24 investi­gated the effect of cyclic dynamic load disturbance on the microstruc­ture of coal using a handmade pendulum test. In addition, the NMR has become increasingly widely employed to quantitatively analyze the pore structure of rocks and more researchers have begun to integrate the SHPB and NMR studies. Some scholars have discovered the effects of rock porosity and porosity follow-up and cyclic loads through micro­scopic NMR studies and dynamic SHPB experiments in sandstone, granite, coal and marble.25–28 The aforementioned researches only examined at one aspect of petrophysical characteristics and multi-scale pore development, neglecting to highlight the effect of cyclic impact, confining pressure and strain rate. The understanding on triaxial cyclic impact fractured coal is still insufficient. Because rocks undergo ground stress under deep ground conditions, which is an inherent issue in the field of rock mechanics but was not addressed in the above research. Therefore, in this paper, the SHPB and NMR were not only used to study the dynamic behavior of coal dynamic characteristics to confining pressure and impact cycle, but also the microscopic pore structure development in response to strain rate after 5 cycles impact. In addition, the 3D profile scanner was utilized to assess macroscopic fracture sur­faces and the fracture roughness variation. The petrophysical charac­teristics and porosity evolution of cyclic fracturing coal under the triaxial impact test were studied from three aspects: microscopic pore structure, macroscopic fracture surface and overall dynamic properties.

To minimize stress wave dispersion caused by sample surface roughness, the loading surface of the coal sample was polished to guarantee that its flatness and perpendicularity were less than 0.02 mm. 2.2.

Additionally, obvious primary multiscale pore and initial cracks can be seen in Fig. 2(b).

NMR test system The NMR test equipment is made up of a vacuum water saturation device, a vacuum drying oven and a MR-60 low field NMR core analyzer. The special parameters of MR-60 were shown in Table 3. 2.5. Test procedures The exact testing procedure is depicted in Fig. 5. Following the processing, the coal specimens were placed in a desktop vacuum drying oven (temperature set at 40 ◦C) for 24 h drying, with the condition of full drying regarded when the observed mass inaccuracy after drying did not exceed 0.1%. The coal specimens were then put in the specimen carrier bed and the NMR analysis system determined the T2 spectrum distribution. The test was repeated to check that the data disparities were genuine. The specimens were then removed and soaked in a vac­uum saturator for 24 h at a vacuum pressure of −0.95 MPa. The coal samples were re-analyzed using the MR-60 carrier bed. In the pre- experimental test, the surface damage emerged more clearly after the fifth impact under dynamic triaxial impact. As a result, the impact cycle number was limited to 5 in order to investigate the petrophysical characteristic and porosity evolution of coal. The fracture surface roughness could be determined using 3D profile scanner after 5 cycle impact (2–10 MPa confining pressure). Finally, the NMR experimental methods described above were repeated. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Variation of the dynamic mechanical characteristic under cyclic impact 3.1.1. Variation of the dynamic peak stress under cyclic impact The dynamic mechanical characteristics of coal were investigated under 2–10 MPa confining pressures. For display and analysis, the stress-strain curve of cyclic impact under 1.0 MPa impact pressure and 2 MPa confining pressure was used. In Fig. 6, the stress-strain curves Fig. 6.

The peak stress under the dynamic triaxial cycle impact showed the quartic polynomial relationship with the impact cycle number and confining pressure. In Fig. 7(a), The dynamic peak stress reached its maximum under 2 and 4 MPa confining pressures at the second impact and the maximum under 6 MPa confining pressure at the third impact. Under 8 MPa confining pressure, as well as 10 MPa, peak stress decreased overall. The lower confining pressure caused the coal’s rich interior pores and fissures to compact ahead of time. The immediate load caused the fractures to close more completely when the impact load was applied. Therefore, the influence on compressive strength was optimized rather than decreased before the certain impact cycle number. However, when higher 8 and 10 MPa confining pressures were applied before impact, all initial fissures closed and secondary cracks formed in advance. The impact load directly caused larger-scale fractures and lost strength. In Fig. 7(b), the peak stress showed the W-shape except for the sec­ond impact, reaching its maximum under 6 MPa. Therefore, it was determined that 6 MPa in the process of cyclic impact could provide the most comprehensive compaction of micropores and fractures in coal, resulting in the highest peak stress. When the confining pressure was increased again, the internal microcracks of coal began expand, reducing the dynamic compressive strength. 3.1.2. Variation characteristics of peak strain under cyclic impact For the investigation, the strain-time histories of the cyclic impact under 2 MPa confining pressure were used. In Fig. 8, the strain increased and subsequently decreased with loading time. The strain tended to decrease after the peak strain was attained due to the plastic deforma­tion of the elastic after-effect. Additionally, when the impact cycle number increased, the peak strain increased and subsequently decreased, reaching a maximum at the second impact, which was equivalent to the peak stress. Furthermore, the peak strain occurrence time tended to decrease, suggesting that the failure time of coal was earlier and the damage more rapid. As shown in Fig. 9, the peak strain also showed the quartic poly­nomial relationship with the impact cycle number and the confining Fig. 8.

In Fig. 9(a), the peak strains under 2 MPa and 4 MPa confining pressure appeared in the second impact, while that of 6 MPa confining pressure appeared in the third cycle and showed an increasing trend under 8 and 10 MPa confining pressure. This critical impact cycle number corresponded to peak stress. Under 2–6 MPa confining pressure, the peak strain and peak stress exhibited a positive connection, indi­cating that the larger the compressive strength, the greater the defor­mation before the damage. While the peak strain and compressive strength showed a negative correlation under 8 and 10 MPa confining pressure, indicating that the smaller the compressive strength, the greater the final failure deformation before the damage. In the Fig. 9(b), the peak strain showed U-shaped distribution with the confining pressure and the minimum value after the first three cycles impact appeared under 8 MPa confining pressure, while the fourth and fifth appeared under 6 MPa. Under the low cycle impact, 8 MPa confining pressure was better capable of minimizing the deformation. In contrast, the stability of the coal diminished fast and the damage was more severe during the fourth and fifth impacts. Instead, 6 MPa confining pressure proved more resistant to deformation and damage. 3.1.3. Variation characteristics of damage variable under cyclic impact According to34, the nature of rock instability and destructive damage was the energy release and dissipation. Therefore, when the coal absorbed energy, internal damage was unavoidable. The formulation of Fig. 11. Variation of D with the impact cycle number and the confining pressure.

In Fig. 10, the strain energy Up was calculated by integrating the stress-strain curve of the coal and reflected the energy spent by the unit when damage and plastic deformation occurred. Ue denoted the releasable strain energy held in the unit, which was the elastic strain energy released once the coal unit was unloaded. The concept of absorption energy density UA was established and computed as the ratio of absorbed energy to coal’s volume, which rep­resents the energy absorbed by the coal unit.14,35 As demonstrated by Eqs.

When the D = 0, the coal unit was completely intact, with no damage or energy loss. When the D = 1, the material was destroyed since the unit could sustain all of the energy dissipation. With the exception of the first impact, the damage degree after each impact was estimated from the preceding impact, hence the cyclic impact damage degree was determined using the Eq. (5). Daccumulative ={ D1(n = 1)D(n−1) + Dn(1 −D(n−1)accumulative)(n ≥2)(5) Dn is the damage variable produced after the nth cyclic impact; D(n−1)accumulative is the (n-1) th cumulative damage variable; n is the number of cyclic impacts. The damage variables, same as peak stress and peak strain, exhibited the quartic polynomial connection with confining pressure and impact cycle number in Fig. 11. As shown in Fig. 11(a), the variation in damage variable with impact cycle number was the same under 2–6 MPa and the same under 8 and 10 MPa confining pressure. Furthermore, the damage variable under 2–6 MPa confining pressure exhibited the greatest in­crease rate at the second or third impact. After attaining peak strength, cracks began to form quickly and the damage became more severe. The damage following the first impact was substantial since the early frac­tures under 8 and 10 MPa confining pressure had already closed.

When the coal was damaged, the energy dissipation became more severe, and the damage degree increased. Therefore, the confining pressure aided in the buildup of energy. When the coal was damaged, the energy dissi­pation became more severe and the damage degree increased37. In Fig. 11(b), the variation in D was not noticeable under 2–6 MPa confining pressures, but it began to grow dramatically under 8 and 10 MPa confining pressures. It suggested that after the critical confining pressure of 6 MPa, the damage to coal became more visible. The related results demonstrated that there existed the 6 MPa critical confining pressure, which altered the petrophysical behavior of the coal such as peak stress, peak strain and damage variable. In addition, the equation of the damage variable under the combined effect of impact number and confining pressure was also fitted in Fig. 11 (c). The fitted surface was somewhat pushed down for ease of sight and it was clear that the fitted surface had a high degree of fit to the original surface. The damage variable followed the log-normal distribution with the number of impacts and the confining pressure, the fitted equation was as follows.

Therefore, the split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) was utilized to investigate the impact cycle effect and confining pressure effect on dynamic behavior of coal. Furthermore, the low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was utilized to evaluate the modification of multiscale pore before and after 5 cycles impacts. Finally, the 3D profile scanner was utilized to quantify fracture surfaces and assess fracture roughness variation. The results showed that there existed the 6 MPa critical confining pressure that altered the dynamic mechanical properties of coal. Due to the combined effect of the confining pressure and cycle impact, the damage variable based on the energy method showed a log-normal distribution. With increasing strain rate, the micropores evolved into mesopores and macropores. There was a critical strain rate that caused the ratio of effective porosity to total porosity to shift from increasing to decreasing. Furthermore, the fracture roughness was shown to be positively correlated with the ratio and negatively correlated with seepage fractal dimension. The research findings can provide theoretical guidance for the safer and more efficient CBM exploitation.   1. Introduction Coalbed methane (CBM) is a typical unconventional clean energy resource with vast deposits across the world and how to exploit it safely and effectively is currently a cause of worry.1–5,7,9 Fig. 1 is a classic schematic diagram of CBM extraction. Nowadays, the most common surface borehole mechanism for CBM extraction is to drain confined water from the coal seam, reduce the pressure in the coal reservoir, promote the desorption of adsorbed methane into a large amount of free methane. It migrates to the wellhead under the action of formation pressure and wellbore pressure difference.6,8,10 Hydraulic fracturing has been outlawed in an increasing number of countries, including France, Germany, etc. Because it involves pouring massive volumes of water, sand and chemicals into wells, which could contaminate the environ­ment and induce earthquakes. Due to the urgent demand of resource development, more and more academics have begun to concentrate on the deflagration fracturing method. However, the dynamic fracturing technology is relatively novelty, its mechanism has received little attention. As the depth of coal resource mining increases, so does the challenges encountered by the deflagration fracturing method in CBM extraction. To begin, coals are subjected to ground stresses in deep earth settings, which induce significant changes in dynamic characteristics.11, 12 Second, whether using the drilling-blasting method or deflagration fracturing method, a single impact cannot always cause the coal seam to break or accomplish the desired result. In practice, it is frequently loaded several times and the dynamic mechanical characteristics under cycle effects exhibit clear changes.13,15,36 Multiple loading can also ensure the development of coal seam fracture network and achieve the maximum efficiency of CBM exploitation. Finally, it is also critical to investigate the fracture mechanism and fracture network development characteristics of the blast-based instantaneous dynamic fracturing coal seam.16–18 The formation of pore structures and fracture networks can contribute in gas desorption and flow in coal seams.

Chen and M. Humatrix.14,15 Microcracks develop inside the crack process zone in frontof the moving crack tip, where the strained matrix undergoing irre-versible deformation receives additional weakening due to the diffusionof environmental agents,16 such as water molecules or hydrogen ionsreacting with the matrix, resulting in rupture of bonds.17,18 At thecontinuum scale, the laboratory investigations by Ciantia et al. Ref. 19have shown that carbonate rocks (as a representative for reactivematrix) under chemical environments exhibit an induced ductiliza-tion effect (i.e., flattening of the post-peak strain–stress curves) anda degradation of the rock’s yield limit depending on the progress oftotal chemical mass removal. These observations are summarized in arecently developed chemo-hydro-mechanical model for homogeneousreactive rocks,20 where a transition in matrix transport from diffusion-dominated to diffusion–advection regime enabled by chemical erosionis highlighted. To achieve the predictive power, model calibration un-der controlled laboratory conditions with homogeneous reactive matrixis in demand, which motivates the design of the present study.So far, the experimental efforts on characterizing the dynamic prop-agation of a single tensile crack have been focusing on the correlationof macroscopic crack growth rate and the fracture toughness, as wellas the influence of the surrounding environment. Classically, the resultsare represented by a diagram depicting the phenomenological relation-ship between the stress intensity factor 𝐾𝐼and the logarithm of cracktip velocity during subcritical crack growth, based on measurementsfrom double torsion tests on various materials, such as brittle soda-lime glass,21 carbonate-rich quartz13 and single calcite crystal,22 undereither dry or wet environment. In terms of the influencing factors,the size effect of chevron notched rock-cores on the determinationof fracture toughness 𝐾𝐼𝐶has been studied through the implementa-tion of three-point bending tests,23,24 while laboratory-scale hydraulicfracturing tests were performed on sandstone specimens25 and shalespecimens26 to explore the role of inherent system heterogeneity onfracture propagation, just to name a few. The impact of the surroundingenvironment is not considered directly in these classical experimentalsetups. More recently, microscopic characterization techniques, suchas acoustic emission (AE) monitoring27 and X-ray tomography,28 havebeen incorporated to reveal more precise information on the locationand time-lapse evolution of micro-crack development around the ad-vancing crack tip through AE signals or detection of discontinuitiesin the deformation field. However, visualizing the real-time dynamiccrack propagation process within a rock specimen remains challeng-ing due to technical limitations as well as the non-transparency andintricate internal structure of the rock matrix. Here, we investigate thechemically-assisted mode I crack propagation utilizing brittle hydrogelas an analogue material, which is transparent and low-permeability.Hydrogel has often been employed to study crack propagationbehavior owing to its reproducibility in terms of the mechanical proper-ties mimicking diverse rock types and its transparency allowing directobservation of macroscopic crack growth.29–32 Notably, a fluid-drivencracking experiment consistent with the analytical asymptotic crack-tipsolution using brittle polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blocks has beenreported in, Ref. 33 where the continuous measurement of the crackopening was obtained by a photometric analysis of the images withoutinterfering with crack growth within the PMMA. PMMA has also beenplaced in a Hele-Shaw cell for analyzing the shift in the stress fieldand crack branching induced by the pre-existing flaws in materials.34,35Gelatin-based hydrogel has been utilized to study rock behavior in deepsubsurface formations, for example in Ref. 36 where clear visualizationof the two-dimensional bi-wing hydraulic fracturing propagation undervarious injection conditions is enabled, and in Refs. 37, 38 the cracknetwork forming process driven by internal gas generation due toyeast fermentation. During these experiments, the gelatin is placedwithin a Hele-Shaw cell setup to simulate the plane strain conditions.For three-dimensional injection tests, brittle polyacrylamide gel hasbeen used as analogue material for the rock matrix capturing e.g., themorphological evolution of a mode I penny-shaped crack, as well asslip-lines in the form of logarithmic spirals nucleating from controlledheterogeneity.39,40 To the best of our knowledge, however, limitedexperimental studies have so far addressed the dynamic propagationof a single crack in such analogue materials focusing on the influenceof a reactive environment.We present in this contribution an experimental investigation withina Hele-Shaw cell studying the growth of an individual chemically-assisted crack driven by injection of reactive solutions into the analoguesystem, capturing the dynamic evolution from the subcritical crackingregime to the abrupt fracturing regime. The paper is organized asfollows. In Section 2, the materials used in the experiment, preparationof the alginate hydrogel, the experimental setup and the specific pro-cedure of crack initiation are described. High-resolution imaging anddigital image correlation (DIC) technique are incorporated to enabledetailed capturing of the time-lapse propagation of a macroscopic crackand the evolving strain field around the advancing crack-tip. Section 3reports the experimental results from injection of reactive fluids withdifferent chemical intensities. By correlating the crack tip velocity withthe stress intensity factor we obtain archetypal three-region curves fortensile crack propagation, based on which the influence of chemicalenvironment is analyzed. Our main findings from the experiment aresummarized in Section 4.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialsIn order to investigate the propagation of an individual crack subjectto a chemical environment, we use a specifically fabricated alginatehydrogel as the analogue material for experimental investigation. Thistype of hydrogel has been extensively studied in the literature as,for example, alternative biomaterials for tissue engineering, drug de-livery and 3D printing technology41–43 due to its bio-compatibilityand flexible strength support. Here alginate hydrogel is used for itsquasi-brittle characteristics44 mimicking the rock behavior and thetransparency of the medium allowing effective tracking of deformationfield.45 The fabricating mechanism of an alginate gel is that the alginatechains in aqueous solution crosslink ionically with the divalent cations,e.g., Ca2+, to form an infinite network resulting in a transparent orsemi-transparent solid hydrogel. The mechanical characteristics of analginate hydrogel can thereby be adjusted by varying the proportion ofthe crosslinkers.46 An additional property of a cured alginate gel is thatit is dissoluble upon exposure to a sodium citrate (SC) solution47, whichis desired in this experiment for mimicking the chemical softeningeffect that an acid environment imposes on a rock matrix.To fabricate the alginate hydrogel, a stock solution of 1 wt% algi-nate was first poured into a beaker. Then we added CaCO3 particlesat 40% of the weight of alginate for providing divalent cations, and asuitable amount of 9-13 μm glass spheres of similar density to water asparticle tracers for the deformation analysis. After a thorough mixingto ensure an even distribution of the involved matters, the gelationprocess was initiated by adding 3.2% w/v of GDL solution into thealginate/CaCO3 mixture to achieve a 2:1 molar ratio of GDL and CaCO3,which would subsequently dissociate Ca2+ from the CaCO3 particlesby a decrease of the solution pH value via its slow hydrolysis. Thehomogeneity of formed gel medium can be promoted by controlling thegelation process at a gradual pace.48 All the procedures were conductedat room temperature. The chemicals used for the experiment are alginicacid sodium salt (powder, Sigma-Aldrich), D-Gluconic acid 𝛿-lactone(GDL, ≥99.0%), calcium carbonate (99.5%, ≤30 μm, Aladdin), sodiumcitrate dihydrate (≥99%, FG, Sigma-Aldrich). All the reagents wereused as received and all the solutions were prepared using deionized(DI) water.```"

Chen and M. HuFig. 1. Schematic of the experimental setup: a Hele-Shaw cell made up of two glass plates with 180 mm diameter sandwiching the cured alginate hydrogel with a thickness of1 mm is placed on the optical table. Zoomed-in image shows a perforated hole on the side wall of acrylic tube, which is designed to aid the direction of injecting fluid and toinduce a fluid-driven crack in the hydrogel.2.2. Experimental setupIn this experiment, a Hele-Shaw cell system was built to focusour study on the fluid-driven crack propagation under plane strainconditions. It consists of two circular glass plates (of 100 mm diameterand 6 mm thickness), which are separated by plastic spacers to forman O-ring cell with a gap thickness of 1 mm, as sketched in Fig. 1. Anacrylic tube (6 mm outer diameter and 4 mm inner diameter) connectsto a cavity (6.4 mm in diameter) opened at the center of the top plate.A 1 mm-hole was perforated on the side wall of the acrylic tube, whichdirects the flow of the pressurized fluid in the hydrogel upon injection.The end of the tube was sealed with epoxy resin and connected to thereservoir with tubing. An open outer boundary of the Hele-Shaw cellwas considered in the experiment. To ensure isolation from vibrations,the device was fixed on an optical platform, as shown in Fig. 1. Aflat LED light source and black background were installed to improvethe quality of deformation field tracking. The procedure of injection isdetailed below.Before the experiment, the prepared alginate mixture was pouredinto the Hele-Shaw cell for curing over 1 h. Upon the gelation, a thinand transparent host hydrogel of O-ring shape was formed within thecell, allowing for a direct and clear visualization of the dynamic prop-agation of the macroscopic crack. After creating a cavity in the formedhydrogel, the fluid was first injected to fill the cavity under a smallpressure to avoid any disturbance. Then the upper end of the cavitywas sealed by a transparent acrylic tape to restrict the direction offluid flow only through the perforated hole. During the experiment, thedynamic evolution of the fluid-driven crack and that of the deformationof the host gel were captured by a digital camera (ZCAM) with a 30 mmf3.5 Macro lens (OLYMPUS) to acquire high-resolution (3840 × 2160)time-lapse images at 60 fps for further analysis. For all the experiments,the injected fluid was governed by a custom pressure profile (as shownin Fig. 2) controlled by a pressure pump (Cobalt autonomous pressurepump COB-2, Elveflow) consisting of three main stages described asfollows:Stage 1: Firstly, a pressure pulse of 25 kPa was applied for 30 msto ensure a successful formation of a fluid-driven crack in the hosthydrogel extending from the perforated hole;Stage 2: The fluid pressure was then removed allowing the hydrogelto relax to a steady state via unloading, which would end up with athin crack of approximately 𝑤0∕𝐿0 = 0.1 in 6 s (as shown in the insetof Fig. 2), where 𝑤0 represents an average width of the crack and 𝐿0represents the crack length at the end of Stage 2;Stage 3: Subsequently, a constant pressure of 5 kPa was applied toreactivate and drive the propagation of the pre-existing crack until theend of the experiment. This is the main stage for our experimentalobservations. To establish a reference point for the deformation analy-sis, we define a starting time 𝑡0 by identifying the onset of the changebetween consecutive images at the end of Stage 2. All the time discussedbelow is measured relative to 𝑡0.In order to mimic the effect of a variable intensity of the chemicalenvironment characterized by the hydrogel’s mass removal rate ̇𝜉6,three different concentrations of injection fluid were adopted in ourexperiment, i.e., pure water, 0.1M SC solution and 0.2M SC solution,respectively. Meanwhile, the mechanical properties of the alginatehydrogel were kept unaltered in all experiments by fixing the contentratios of alginate and CaCO3, for the sake of consistency.3. Results3.1. Image processing procedure for tracking the propagation of a macro-scopic crackFollowing the fluid injection procedure detailed in Section 2.2 forinducing a mode I fluid-driven crack propagation, we recorded theevolving crack morphology starting from the beginning of Stage 3,i.e., 𝑡= 𝑡0. Specifically, we acquired the continuous displacementof the tip of the propagating fluid-driven crack and simultaneouslythe deformation field of the host gel. Image processing technique inImageJ49 was utilized to assist analyzing the time-lapsed digital imagestaken from the experiment, starting from 𝑡0 where the gel was relaxedafter an initiation of a tensile crack extending from the injection hole.The processing procedure is outlined below:(a) The raw color image set was first calibrated against a knownscale, in this experiment by placing a ruler next to and at the samelevel as the Hele-Shaw cell. The image set was cropped to the regionof interest (ROI) where the tensile crack underwent propagation afterinitiation, as shown in Fig. 3a. Specifically, in Fig. 3a the host alginatehydrogel is represented as a brownish background wherein the con-taining micro-glass spheres evenly dispersed in the medium are shownas small white dots, and the lips of the fluid-driven crack refer to theinterface between the black region (the moving macro-crack) and thebrownish background (the host alginate hydrogel);(b) The obtained image set was then converted to 8-bit grayscale.Background subtraction was applied to eliminate the noise and unevenillumination followed by a bandpass filter to enhance the boundaryregion of the crack lips against the host hydrogel. The processed imageset was made binary after a successful regulation of the crack openingarea by thresholding, as illustrated in Fig. 3b. Sequential time-lapseimages defining the propagation of the fluid-driven crack were therebyobtained for analysis, with an interval of 0.033 s per image.```"

The white dashed line connecting the crack tip points (the white solid dots) shows the crack-tip propagationpath, which defines the direction of the 𝑥-axis in the analysis. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of thisarticle.)3.2. Propagation of the tip of a fluid-driven crack under chemical erosionBased on the results of the above-described image processing proce-dure, the evolving morphology of the crack opening under the injectionof pure water is shown in Fig. 3c at a time interval of 0.33 s within 2 sstarting from 𝑡0. The moving trajectory of the crack tip (representedby the white dots in Fig. 3c) is indicated by the white dashed line.As constrained by the Hele-Shaw cell, this tensile crack propagationis assumed to be in 2D under plane strain conditions. The x- and y-axes for the current analysis are defined by the propagation directionof the tensile crack in the first 2 s. The crack propagation here istreated as uni-directional extending along the 𝑥-axis away from theinjection hole. In all our experiments, the injected fluid immediatelyfills in the crack opening and no significant fluid hysteresis right behindthe advancing crack tip was observed, which is consistent with theanalytical prediction50 that within the toughness-dominated region thefluid lag appears to be exponentially small with respect to the hydrogeltoughness.The propagation distance of the fluid-driven crack tip as a functionof the elapsed time under three chemical environments, namely purewater, 0.1M and 0.2M SC solution, is plotted in Fig. 4(a). For eachchemical concentration, three sets of independent tests were conductedin the Hele-Shaw cell under the same boundary conditions with errorbars incorporated in Fig. 4(a) to indicate the uncertainty induced bymultiple variables involved in the process. The injection of pure water(mean values indicated by the black squares in Fig. 4(a)), i.e., a neutralpH environment, serves as a reference case where no chemical softeningeffect is accounted. When 0.1M SC solution is applied as the injectionfluid, we observe that the propagation profile is similar to the referencecase in the first 1.0 s, followed by an acceleration in the time-dependentpropagation, indicating that an accumulated softening effect due to thereaction between the injected sodium citrate solution and the hydrogelstarts to play a role in lowering the material toughness. With theinjection of 0.2M SC solution, the acceleration in the crack propagationis brought forward to be much earlier than 1.0s, as shown in the insetof Fig. 4(a). Consequently, the resulting propagation is faster than thecounterpart test of 0.1M SC solution injection. The variation of theobtained results of 0.2M SC solution injection in this early stage ofcrack development appears to be the largest as a result of the amplifiedcoupling between the stress concentration developed in the vicinity ofthe crack tip and the enhanced chemical dissolution due to diffusion ofthe chemical agents.The time evolution of crack tip velocity is obtained by applyinga differentiation on the crack tip displacement curves, as shown inFig. 4(b). We observe that for all the three cases the crack tip velocityvaries little in the early stage of development. Under the injection of```"

Mean values are represented by solid pointsand the variation between tests are represented by the error bars. (b) Crack tip velocity versus time under different chemical environment. The crack tip velocity is calculated byaveraging the slopes between each data point and its two neighbors in the crack displacement curves with the differentiation function 𝑓′(𝑥𝑖) = 12 ( 𝑦𝑖+1−𝑦𝑖𝑥𝑖+1−𝑥𝑖+ 𝑦𝑖−𝑦𝑖−1𝑥𝑖−𝑥𝑖−1 ). Two magnifiedviews show the crack development in the subcritical regime and its transition to abrupt fracturing.pure water, the crack tip propagation exhibits an initial low rate growth(approximately 0.75 mm/s) for about 0.8s, and subsequently undergoesa smooth transition from the subcritical regime to a significantly ac-celerated crack tip velocity. A following deceleration in crack growthrate is observed after about 1.7 s, and the crack tip velocity graduallystabilizes to be around 8 mm/s, which is roughly an order of mag-nitude greater than that in the initial development stage. During thisaccelerated stage the crack propagation is predominantly governed bythe mechanical rupture by the imposed constant injection pressure. Thepropagation of the crack tip driven by pure water reaches a maximumdistance of 13.8 mm in 3 s as shown in Fig. 4(a). The crack extension forthe same duration increases by 43% (to 19.7 mm) when a chemicallyreactive 0.1M SC solution was utilized as the fracturing fluid (Fig. 4(a)).This softening effect by introducing a chemical environment is alsoevident in the crack tip velocity profile, where a greater accelerationis observed after a relatively sharper transition from the subcriticalregime to fracturing regime with the velocity stabilizing at a greatervalue (around 10 mm/s). We infer the underlying mechanism as thechemical agents diffusing into the gel matrix through the crack lipsdebonding the hydrogel’s ionic crosslinkers through Ca2+ chelation andhence weakening the toughness in the vicinity of the crack tip. Thestabilized crack velocity after the transition indicates a balance betweenthe chemical softening effect on the gel toughness and the requiredenergy to extend the crack surfaces. As observed from Fig. 4(b), whenthe chemical intensity of the fracturing fluid is increased to a 0.2M SCsolution, the elevation in the crack tip velocity signaling a transitionfrom the subcritical regime to the fracturing regime occurs earlier thanthe case of 0.1M SC solution, by roughly 0.2 s. Under this intensifiedchemical environment, the crack tip velocity is increasing (rather thanstabilizing), approaching a magnitude of 16 mm/s at 3 s. This outbal-ance suggests a more pronounced coupling effect between the chemicalreaction and the mechanical process, i.e., the time scale defined bythe chemical mass removal rate is more comparable to the counterpartdefined by the crack propagation rate under the applied chemical andmechanical loads.3.3. Correlation between macroscopic crack growth and SIF in chemicalenvironmentThe stress intensity factor (SIF) representing the level of stressconcentration in front of the crack tip has been a salient feature inthe study of crack growth mechanism. Here, an asymptotic solutiondescribing the opening of a fluid-driven crack 𝑤as a function of themode I SIF 𝐾𝐼within the framework of LEFM51 is employed, assumingthe compressibility of the injected fluid is negligible:𝑤∼4𝐾𝐼𝐸′ (( 2𝑥𝜋))1∕2, 𝑥𝐿≪1(1)where 𝐸′ denotes the effective Young’s modulus, expressed as 𝐸′ =𝐸∕(1 −𝜈2) under plane strain conditions. 𝑥denotes the distance fromthe crack tip point, 𝐿denoting the crack length. Quasi-static criterionfor the propagation of crack is assumed here, and upon propagation 𝐾𝐼is considered equivalent to the fracture toughness of the material 𝐾𝐼𝑐.We plot the advancing velocity of the crack 𝑣versus normalizedSIF 𝐾𝐼∕𝐸′ under the three chemical environments, as shown in Fig. 5.Under the condition of pure water injection, the 𝐾𝐼∕𝐸′-𝑣curve exhibitsa characteristic three-region development.17 Region I features an in-crease of the crack tip velocity along with an increasing stress intensityfactor. This region is nearly negligible, as shown in Fig. 5, due to thefact that the experiment is conditioned at the injected fluid filling thepre-existing crack at the starting time 𝑡0. Region II features a constantcrack tip velocity at around 0.8 mm/s as the value of 𝐾𝐼∕𝐸′ increases,accumulating microstructural energy to be released in the fracturingregime (Region III). This subcritical regime of crack development un-der the pressurization of pure water continues till 𝐾𝐼∕𝐸′ reaches thethreshold of 0.24, after which we observe a dramatic acceleration incrack growth velocity, as shown in Fig. 5.When applying the SC solutions (0.1M and 0.2M) as the fractur-ing fluid, the 𝐾𝐼∕𝐸′-𝑣curves also exhibit three-region characteristics;however, the subcritical regime is shorted compared with the caseof pure water injection. Within Region II, the crack tip velocity isslightly elevated than the reference case (pure water injection), reach-ing approximately 1 mm/s and 1.2 mm/s, for the 0.1M and 0.2MSC injection, respectively. This indicates that the effect of chemicalsoftening is evident in the subcritical regime of chemically assistedcrack propagation.6 With a higher chemical intensity of the imposedenvironment, an earlier transition to Region III (the fracturing regime)is expected as the chemical degradation on the toughness of the gelmatrix in front of the crack tip meets the threshold value faster in amore reactive environment. Mechanical rupture dominates Region III,where the crack velocity undergoes an exponential development in thechemically degraded gel matrix. We also report based on Fig. 5 that (1)the gel after the treatment of SC solution fractures in a more ductilemanner compared to the reference case of pure water fracturing, and(2) with an intensified chemical field (a higher concentration of SC```"

Competing mechanism between crack tip blunting and chemical soften-ingAn additional influencing factor determining the growth of an indi-vidual (chemically assisted) fluid-driven crack is the geometric effect inthe tip region. We observed that the crack tip maintains a sharp angleunder pure water injection, as shown in Fig. 6a and 6c, at 𝑡= 0.66 sand 𝑡= 1.96 s, respectively. As the crack advances, the crack tipopening displacement gradually increases in both the subcritical regime(Fig. 6a) and the transition regime (Fig. 6c), and the sharp tip indicatesa persistent brittle behavior of the host alginate gel during crack prop-agation. In contrast, under the injection of 0.2M SC solution, a bluntingeffect of the crack tip is observed. At 𝑡= 0.66 s, the propagating cracktip (Fig. 6b) is evidently less sharp than the counterpart in the referencecase of pure water (Fig. 6a), alleviating the stress concentration in frontof the crack tip point due to a sharp geometry of the crack tip. Thelips of the moving crack are also affected by the chemical erosion ofthe filling fluid as a result of SC solution injection. Small patches ofthe alginate hydrogel and a possible inclusion of the added micro-glassbeads are detaching from the solid into the fluid phase contained in thecrack opening, as shown in the circled region in Fig. 6b. No obviousfluid lag is observed in our experiment using injection of either SCsolutions or pure water. The crack tip blunting effect adds anotherlayer of feedback between the mechanical rupture and the chemicalprocesses, i.e., the reaction rate and the diffusion coefficient in theprocess zone20, via a geometry-induced redistribution of the stress field.Within the subcritical regime, the macroscopic crack containingpressurized 0.2M SC solution sustains a blunted tip-profile, as shownin Fig. 6b (at 𝑡= 0.66 s) and Fig. 6d (at 𝑡= 1.96 s). The phe-nomenon of crack tip blunting due to chemical erosion, as observedin our experiment, relaxes the stress field around the crack tip dueto vanishing of the singularity point, resulting in a decreased strainenergy density. In classical fracture mechanics without consideringFig. 6. Crack-tip morphology during crack development under non-reactive andreactive environment: (a, c) pure water injection at 𝑡= 0.66 s and 1.96 s, respectively;(b, d) under the injection of 0.2M SC solution at 𝑡= 0.66 s and 1.96 s, respectively.Minor detachment from the hydrogel matrix represented by clusters of white dots (redcircle in b) is observed during the crack tip advancement, and the crack-tip bluntingindicates the brittle hydrogel undergoing a chemical ductilization effect within thecrack-tip process zone. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figurelegend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)environmental influences, the development of crack tip blunting isoften interpreted as an equivalent increase in the material’s fracturetoughness.11 This geometric aspect, from the energetic perspective,hence plays the role of slowing down the crack propagation, whichis however compensated by the chemical weakening effect on thehydrogel as the chemical agents diffuse into and react with the matrix.The degree of chemical weakening is dependent on the intensity ofthe irreversible damage, and is hence most pronounced in the process```"

The dynamic balance betweenthe competition between the geometry induced ‘‘toughening’’ and thechemically induced ‘‘softening’’ defines the subcritical regime.During the experiment, digital image correlation (DIC) is incorpo-rated to visualize how the deformation field is affected by the injectionof chemically reactive fluids in the vicinity of the crack tip. The analysisof the strain patterns is based on processing the gray-scale experimentalimage sets obtained at 30 fps using an open-source DIC softwareNcorr.52 By tracking the displacement of sufficient small subsets rep-resented by the added glass spheres between the initial and subsequentconfigurations, the evolving strain field of the hydrogel matrix overtime is captured. The region of interest (ROI) selected for strain analysisis the near-crack tip region, where positive and negative values of theshear strain component 𝜖𝑥𝑦correspond to the counterclock- and clock-wise directions, respectively. A comparison between the contours of theshear strain field at the crack tip without and with chemical erosion(i.e., injection of pure water and 0.2M SC solution, respectively), isshown in Fig. 7a and Fig. 7b. In the case of pure water injection, themagnitude of the maximum absolute shear strain increases during thesubcritical regime and the value reaches 0.0455 at 𝑡= 1.0 s. The anglebetween the central line of the maximum shear deformation region andthe direction of the propagation of the macroscopic crack is roughly110◦, as illustrated in Fig. 7a. When 0.2M SC solution instead of purewater is the injection fluid, the shear strain field in front of the cracktip develops faster. The maximum absolute shear strain in this case at𝑡= 1.0 s reaches 0.0589, and the central line of the maximum shearregion is around 106◦inclined to the crack propagation direction.We also plotted the distribution of the shear strain along the 𝑦-axisoriginating from the crack tip for both cases at 𝑡= 0.5 s and 𝑡= 1.0 s,as shown in Fig. 7c. At 𝑡= 0.5 s, the maximum shear by pure waterinjection occurs very close to the crack tip, while with 0.2M SC solutionthe maximum shear shifts towards to 4.5 mm away (along the y-axis)from the crack tip. At 𝑡= 1.0 s, the maximum shear occurs at the cracktip for both conditions of injection; however, the magnitude of shear```"

Atthe location of 𝑦= 5.0 mm, the magnitude of shear strain with 0.2MSC solution injection upon 𝑡= 1.0 s is 56.5% larger than that inthe reference case of pure water. An overall trend observed is thatcompared to pure water, a chemically reactive environment enhancesthe development of the shear strain field around the crack tip and theenhancement becomes more pronounced as time progresses. Besides, itis interesting to note that the maximum difference in the shear strainprofile (Fig. 7c) between the two injection conditions appears to be acertain distance away from the crack tip, indicating the location for themost severe damage-reaction coupling.4. ConclusionWe have presented in this contribution an experimental inves-tigation into the effect of a reactive chemical environment on thegrowth of an individual fluid-driven crack. A series of experimentswas conducted on alginate hydrogel as an analogue material of low-permeability rocks contained in a Hele-Shaw cell. The scale effect ofreaction (dissolution) rates on propagation of the induced single tensilecrack was examined, exposed to different chemical intensities, usingpure water, 0.1M SC and 0.2M SC solution, respectively, as the injectionfluid. Our experimental results show that the propagation behavior of asingle macroscopic crack in the hydrogel is strongly dependent on thechemical environment imposed in the crack opening under the samemechanical boundary conditions. An intensified chemical environmentleads to a faster crack propagation. When the chemical dissolutionis at a rate comparable to the mechanical cracking process, a morepronounced acceleration in the displacement of the crack tip appears,as evident in the case of 0.2M SC solution injection. The crack tipvelocity is correlated to the mode I stress intensity factor 𝐾𝐼normalizedby the effective Young’s modulus 𝐸′ under the three chemical environ-ments. Each of the obtained 𝐾𝐼∕𝐸′-𝑣curves captures the archetypalthree-region characteristics of a single tensile crack propagation. Ofparticular interest here is Region II where the crack tip velocity appearsto be stable suggesting a dynamic balance between the competitionbetween the crack-tip geometry induced toughening and the chemi-cally induced softening. The evolution of shear strain patterns in thesubcritical regime also suggests that a chemically reactive environmentpromotes the development of the shear deformation field around thecrack tip. Specifically, the maximum magnitude of shear strain in thecase of 0.2M SC solution at 𝑡= 1 s is around 29.5% higher than thecounterpart in the case of pure water injection. In Region III, we reportthe observation that the fracturing in a reactive environment is lessbrittle (but slightly expedited) than the reference case of pure waterenvironment.CRediT authorship contribution statementJing Chen: Investigation, Validation, Writing – original draft.

The mechanism of subcritical crack propagation in achemically reactive environment is essential for understanding of the involved coupled chemo-mechanicalprocess and a better control of acid-assisted hydraulic fracturing. It has been postulated that the rate of crackpropagation under environmental loads is inherited from the chemical processes involved including the reactionand the diffusive transport. However, laboratory explorations focusing on the evolving interplay betweenthe propagation of a fluid-pressurizing individual crack and the environment it is subject to via a variablechemical intensity imposed have been rare. Here we present an experimental investigation on a single tensilecrack propagation in alginate hydrogel as an analogue material for brittle rocks, driven by the injection of achemically reactive fluid kept at constant pressure using a Hele-Shaw cell setup. We show that an intensifiedchemical environment can accelerate tensile crack propagation in both subcritical crack growth and fracturingregimes, while leading to the Region III fracturing of less brittle characteristics. During the experiment, crack-tip blunting upon injection of reactive solutions was observed, suggesting a competing mechanism between thecrack-tip geometry induced toughening and the chemically induced softening within the process zone as thecrack advances. Our results provide quantitative insights into how a chemically reactive environment facilitatesthe growth of a single macroscopic crack of mode I opening in a low-permeability matrix through coupledchemo-mechanical feedback. The imposed chemical environment promotes crack propagation while alleviatingthe stress concentration at the advancing crack tip, suggesting a more energy-efficient method compared topure water fracturing. We anticipate our experimental investigation presented here to be a starting point ofsound laboratory support for future studies towards a more controllable technique of chemical stimulation ingeomaterials as well as complementing the ongoing modeling efforts in reactive chemo-mechanics.1. IntroductionChemical stimulation has been widely incorporated into the opera-tion of hydraulic fracturing as a permeability enhancement techniquefor promoting oil and gas well productivity and achieving optimizedrecovery of energy resources. This well stimulation technique fea-tures an injection of acidic solution into sweet spots of the targetedreservoirs that are normally tight and very low permeable, i.e., ‘‘un-conventional’’ reservoirs.1–3 The technique has shown great potentialin effectively stimulating the growth and connectivity of individualcracks, and hence promoting the efficiency of energy exploitation inareas such as unconventional shale gas and Enhanced Geothermal Sys-tems (EGS). However, the process of acid-assisted hydraulic fracturingis not yet fully understood as it is dynamic and complex involvingvarious mechanisms, including mineral dissolution, chemical erosion,∗Corresponding author.E-mail address: mmhu@hku.hk (M.

Previous studies have demonstrated that freshwater mussels are highly sensitive to K in acute and chronic exposures, and acute toxicity of K decreases with increasing water hardness. However, little is known about the influence of hardness on the chronic toxicity of K. The responses (survival, growth) of test organisms were determined in six concentrations of potassium in 28-day toxicity tests in different hardness waters. The biological, chemical, and water quality data were used to evaluate the potassium toxicity aquatic organisms at different hardness.

The female mussels were transported to Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC), Columbia, MO, and were held in a 550 liter flow-through tank with well water (hardness approximately 300 milligrams per liter as calcium carbonate (CaCO3), alkalinity approximately 250 milligrams per liter as CaCO3, pH approximately 7.8) at a flow rate of 2 liters per minute. The holding water was aerated and maintained at low temperatures (10 to 12 degrees Celsius) to prevent the mussels from releasing their glochidia and to prolong the viability of glochidia. Two plastic containers (56 x 40 x14 cm; without lids) with a 3 cm layer of creek gravel (approximately 0.2 to 1.5 cm diameter) were submerged in the tank. Up to 10 adult mussels were placed into each container. The mussels were fed ad libitum by adding approximately 20 ml of a commercial non-viable microalgal Nannochloropsis concentrate (Nanno 3600) and 20 ml of a unique mix of 6 microalgae (Shellfish Diet 1800; Reed Mariculture) twice daily.</procdesc><procdate>20210301</procdate><proccont><cntinfo><cntperp><cntper>James L Kunz</cntper><cntorg>U.S. Geological Survey, SOUTHEAST REGION</cntorg></cntperp><cntpos>Fish Biologist</cntpos><cntaddr><addrtype>mailing address</addrtype><address>4200 New Haven Road</address><city>Columbia</city><state>MO</state><postal>65201</postal><country>US</country></cntaddr><cntvoice>573-441-2965</cntvoice><cntfax>573-876-1896</cntfax><cntemail>jkunz@usgs.gov</cntemail></cntinfo></proccont></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Juvenile mussel propagation: Beginning in April 2021, roughly equal numbers of glochidia were removed from three adult mussels by gently flushing the mussel marsupia with a syringe filled with the well water. The viability of glochidia isolated from each adult mussel was tested using the valve closure response to sodium chloride (ASTM 2022). The viability of glochidia from all samples ranged from 92 to 98 percent. Glochidia isolated from the adult mussels were pooled for the inoculation in the CERC well water diluted to a hardness of 100 milligrams per liter as CaCO3 (i.e., 100 hard water). Ten host fish (largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides) were held in containers with an agitated suspension of 4000 glochidia per liter for 10 minutes, rinsed, and then transferred into each of 10 fish holding tanks (9 L) in a flow-through system designed to collect juvenile mussels (Barnhart 2006). Water temperature in the fish holding tanks was maintained at 23 degrees Celsius. Juvenile mussels were recovered beginning approximately 2 weeks following the inoculation. Juveniles that were collected from the host fish during a 3-d peak of the drop-off period were cultured in a pulsed flow-through auto-feeding system (Kunz et al. 2020) for 3 weeks before the start of toxicity testing. The juveniles were cultured in the 100 hard water and water temperature was maintained at 22 plus or minus 1 degree Celsius.</procdesc><procdate>20210324</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Water preparation: The five different hardness waters were the CERC well water with a hardness of approximately 300 milligrams per liter as CaCO3 (i.e., 300 hard) and four waters prepared by diluting the well water with deionized water to a hardness of 25, 50, 100, or 200 milligrams per liter as CaCO3 (i.e., 25, 50, 100, and 200 hard water). The five test waters (i.e., base or control waters) were maintained in 5,000- or 7,500-liter polypropylene recirculating tanks at room temperature, 22 to 24 degrees Celsius.</procdesc><procdate>20210428</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Test organism acclimation: Two days before starting the toxicity test, juvenile mussels (cultured in the 100 hard water) were sampled and divided into 5 groups; each was acclimated to one of the five test waters (25, 50, 100, 200, and 300 hard). Specifically, for the acclimation to each test water, a group of approximately 1000 juvenile mussels were first placed in a 1-L glass beaker containing 500 ml of the 100 hard water. The acclimation beakers were held in a water bath at the test temperature of 23 degrees Celsius and gentle aeration was provided through a glass pipette. Approximately 50 percent of the water in the beakers was replaced with the test water twice daily. The juvenile mussels were fed 5 ml of the algal mixture during the acclimation period twice daily in the early morning and late afternoon after water renewal.</procdesc><procdate>20210503</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Exposure chamber stocking: At the beginning of the toxicity test, juvenile mussels, approximately 3-weeks old, were transferred from each acclimation beaker to two stocking chambers (300-ml crystallizing dish with 200 ml of water). Juvenile mussels in the stocking chambers were active (constant foot movement) and had relatively uniform sizes (shell length ranged from approximately 7 to 9 mm). A total of 10 juvenile mussels were impartially transferred into each replicate beaker (ASTM 2022). Specifically, five of the 10 mussels were randomly selected from a stocking chamber under a stereo microscope and placed into a plastic weigh boat (4 x 4 x 0.5 cm) using a syringe system, which was made by connecting a 5-ml syringe to a 60-cm long vinyl tube (2.3-mm inner diameter) with a glass capillary tube (2.2-mm inner diameter) at the other end. The syringe was used to aspirate the mussels into the capillary tube for transfer. After the number of mussels in the weigh boat was verified, the mussels were gently poured into the next replicate beaker of all treatments for a hardness water test in random order. This process was repeated after all beakers for the hardness water test were stocked with 5 mussels. Additional samples of 4 replicates (10 mussels per replicate) were collected and preserved in 70 percent ethanol for subsequent measurements of starting size. The maximum shell lengths of mussels were measured to the nearest 0.001 mm using a digital image analysis system with a stereo microscope, camera, and imaging software (NIS-Elements) on a computer. The total dry weight of mussels in each replicate was determined after the mussels were dried for at least 48 hours at 60 degrees Celsius. The dry weight of pooled mussels in a replicate was measured to the nearest 0.001 mg using a microbalance (Model MX5; Mettler-Toledo) and normalized on a per-individual basis.</procdesc><procdate>20210505</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Exposure System: Five intermittent flow-through proportional diluter systems (Wang et al. 2007) modified from Mount and Brungs (1967) were used simultaneously for the toxicity tests in the five hard waters. Each diluter used one hard water to create and deliver five test concentrations of KCl (99.7 percent purity; Fisher Scientific) with a 50 percent dilution series, plus control water, into replicate glass beakers (300 ml). Each beaker was equipped with a 2.5-cm hole in the side that had been covered with a 50-mesh (279-µm width opening) stainless-steel screen to allow the solution to flow through. The beakers contained 200 ml of water and 5 ml of silica sand (approximately 100- to 400-micrometer particles; Granusil number 5010; Unimin, New Canaan, CT). Four replicate beakers per treatment were held in a holding box and the 6 boxes (one for the 6 treatments in each hardness water) were placed in a water bath. Water temperature was maintained at 23 degrees Celsius. A manifold was attached to each delivery line to partition the flow of a test solution to each of the 4 replicate beakers per treatment (Kunz et al. 2020). The water was delivered through hypodermic needles mounted in silicone stoppers. The needles provided resistance to the water flowing through the manifold so that the flow into each beaker was similar (water volume difference after each cycle was less than 2 percent among replicate beakers). The stream of water produced by the manifold was strong enough to reach the bottom of beaker but not so strong as to disturb the sand substrate and test organisms. In this way, the stream of water helped mix the water column and provide fresh water into the beaker. The diluter provided 125 ml of test solution to each beaker once every 4 hours resulting in approximately 4 water volume additions per day.</procdesc><procdate>20210504</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Autofeeding system: An auto-feeding system was connected to each diluter to feed mussels with an algal mixture following each cycle of water delivery by the diluter (Kunz et al. 2020). A stock of the algal mixture was prepared daily by adding 1 ml of Nanno 3600 and 2 ml of Shellfish Diet 1800 into 1.8 L of test water (algal concentration approximately 510 nanoliters of cell volume per milliliter; Wang et al. 2007). A peristaltic pump (Masterflex L/S model 07522-20 with 7535-08 multichannel head; Cole-Parmer Instrument Company) was automated to deliver the algal mixture to each of 6 solution mixing cells in the diluter a few seconds before the mixing cells filled test solutions and emptied into water delivery lines to the manifolds above replicate beakers. Mussels were fed the algal mixture automatically with each cycling of the diluter every 4 h. The volume of algal delivery by the pump per water cycle was adjusted to provide 2 ml of algal mixture into each replicate beaker to maintain an algal concentration of 2 nanoliters cell volume per milliliter in the beaker (Wang et al. 2018).</procdesc><procdate>20210505</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Maintenance during 28-day exposure: Toxicity test duration was 28 days. Pump performance, food delivery lines, and water flow through manifolds were checked daily. The amounts of algal mixture from food lines per water cycling were confirmed periodically by measuring the algal volume delivered through food lines. Replicate beakers within a holding box for each treatment were rotated randomly at least once a week to minimize the potential impact of minor differences in water flow with food into replicate beakers.</procdesc><procdate>20210504</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Test beakers and sand were replaced on test day 14 to reduce potential effects of accumulated debris and biofilm formation on the beaker surface (Wang et al. 2018b; ASTM 2022). Before the replacement of sand and beakers, mussels in each replicate beaker were first rinsed into a 200-ml glass dish with the test solution from the replicate beaker for survival determination. Mussels with empty shells or with gaped shells containing decomposed tissue were classified as dead and removed from the replicate beakers. Surviving mussels were transferred into new beakers containing new sand.</procdesc><procdate>20210519</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Exposure conclusion: At the end of the 28 day exposures, surviving mussels were counted and preserved in 70 percent ethanol for subsequent measurements of length and dry weight.</procdesc><procdate>20210602</procdate></procstep><procstep><procdesc>Water Quality and Chemical Analyses: Water temperature in the replicate beakers was monitored twice daily in the five diluters. For each test in a hardness water, water quality characteristics (dissolved oxygen, pH, hardness, alkalinity, and total ammonia on a nitrogen basis) were determined using standard methods (Eaton et al. 2005) on composite water samples collected from the replicates in the control, medium, and high exposure concentrations once every week. In addition, conductivity was measured at each exposure concentration at least once weekly to monitor the exposure concentrations in the diluters. Water samples for analyses of major cations (calcium, Ca; K; magnesium, Mg; and sodium, Na), major anions (chloride, Cl and sulfate) were collected from the control waters at the beginning, middle, and end of the 28-d exposures. Water samples for K analyses were also collected from the 5 exposure concentrations at the beginning, middle, and end of the exposures. Water samples for the analyses of K, Ca, Mg, and Na were syringe-filtered (0.45 µm polyethersulfone membrane, PES; USEPA 1993) and preserved within 24 hours of collection by adding a sufficient volume of house-distilled concentrated nitric acid to each sample, to result in a final acid concentration of 2 percent (volume per volume). The chloride and sulfate samples were syringe-filtered (0.45 micrometer PES), and then preserved by refrigeration at 4 degrees Celsius; anions were analyzed within 30 days of sample collection. Concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, and Na were quantified using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS; NexION 2000, PerkinElmer) in analog mode using a method similar to USEPA 6020B (USEPA 2014). Concentrations of chloride and sulfate were measured by anion exchange chromatography with suppressed conductivity detection (ICS-1100, Dionex Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA); this method was similar to USEPA 9056A (USEPA 2007). A minimum of 4 external National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)-traceable calibration standards were used to calibrate the instrument responses; instrument and method performance were verified using continuing calibration and blank verification standards, analytical spikes and duplicate analyses. Analytical spike recoveries were 84 to 110 percent and duplicate analyses had relative percent differences 0 to 10.5 percent for all analytes. Laboratory control solutions (LCS) were used to provide an additional measure of calibration verification for both cation and anion analyses; analyte recoveries from the LCS samples were 88-120 percent. Interference checks were also performed for all ICP-MS measurements using both a check standard and a 5-fold dilution approach; percent differences between results for diluted and undiluted samples were 0 to 11.3 percent and analyte recoveries from the interference check standard were 70 to 110 percent. Reporting limits were 0.1 milligrams per liter each for Ca, K, Mg, and Na, 0.2 milligrams per liter for Cl, and 1.5 milligrams per liter for sulfate.  No samples had concentrations of any analyte below the reporting limit.</procdesc><procdate>20210504</procdate></procstep><method><methtype>lab</methtype><methdesc>Five toxicity 28-day standard toxicity tests,each at a different water hardness, were conducted with 3-week-old juvenile Lampsilis siliquoidea to assess the toxicity of potassium at different water hardness levels</methdesc><methcite><citeinfo><origin>ASTM International</origin><pubdate>2022</pubdate><title>Standard guide for conducting laboratory toxicity tests with freshwater mussels (ASTM E2455-22)</title><geoform>publication</geoform><serinfo><sername>Annual Book of ASTM Standards</sername><issue>Volume 11.06</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>West Conshohocken, PA</pubplace><publish>ASTM International</publish></pubinfo><onlink>https://www.astm.org/Standards/E2455.htm</onlink></citeinfo></methcite><methcite><citeinfo><origin>Barnhart, M.C.</origin><pubdate>2006</pubdate><title>Bucket of muckets: A compact recirculating system for rearing juvenile freshwater mussels</title><geoform>publication</geoform><serinfo><sername>Aquaculture</sername><issue>254</issue></serinfo><pubinfo><pubplace>n/a</pubplace><publish>Elsevier</publish></pubinfo><onlink>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.08.028</onlink></citeinfo></methcite><methcite><citeinfo><origin>Kunz, James L.</origin><origin>Brunson, Eric L.</origin><origin>Barnhart, M.

The soil stress level and the most recent soil stress history were identified as the primary causes of ther­mally induced changes in interface shear strength. For normally NC clay-concrete interface, the temperature was found to lead to higher adhesion and slightly lower friction angle, whereas no effect on shear strength was found for OC clay – concrete interface. Xiao et al. (2019)111 utilized a modified direct shear device for heating and cooling the interface with both a smooth and a rough concrete plate. The purpose was to evaluate both the effect of temper­ature (4.5, 22.5 and 42.5 ◦C) and the effect of the application of 10 temperature cycles (heating 22.5+20 ◦C; cooling 22.5–18 ◦C) prior to shearing on sandy silty clay-concrete interface properties. For smooth interfaces, the effects of temperature were found to be negligible at low normal stress, while the maximum shear strength (at normal stress of 100 kPa) increased by up to 20 % after 10 heating cycles. For rough interfaces, the maximum shear strength increased by up to 23 % at the end of the 10 heating/cooling cycles, regardless of the applied normal stress. In general, the temperature and the water content effect on the interface shear strength became more significant (showing “thermal hardening”, i.e., resistance increase with heating) with increasing interface roughness, in agreement with the observations of Di Donna et al. (2016)1. Vasilescu et al. (2019)113 performed a series of soil-concrete inter­face direct shear tests to examine the impact of temperature cycles on the interface shear strength using saturated silica and carbonate sand samples. The experimental campaign was divided into two parts: the first part consisted of interface direct shear tests at a constant temper­ature of 13 ◦C (used as a reference), and the second part consisted of interface direct shear tests after the application of 10 temperature cycles with an amplitude of 8 and 18 ◦C. They found that in the adopted range of temperature and soil water content, the friction angle at the interface was not significantly modified before and after the temperature cycles (difference of 0.3◦), confirming the low impact of temperature cycles on the interface behaviour in granular soils.

(2021)114 developed a temperature-controlled apparatus modifying a standard triaxial instrument to evaluate the effect of tem­perature (6, 19, 32 and 45 ◦C) on dense sand–aluminium interface shear strength under drained conditions. The results showed negligible in­fluence of the temperature increase on the shear strength and friction angle of the interface, with an approximate average increase rate of 0.0005◦/◦C and 0.0008◦/◦C for the peak and residual value of shear strength respectively. These results confirmed the negligible effects of temperature variations on the interface with coarse-grained soils (such as sands), investigated by other previous studies. Brunelli (2022)92 conducted an experimental campaign to determine the influence of temperature on the behaviour of silty sand and then conducted direct shear tests at the interface between the same (recon­stituted) soil and concrete with temperature control. By comparing the results of tests on heated and not heated interfaces (constant thermal load of 32 ◦C versus room temperature of 20 ◦C), the corresponding shearing resistance failure envelopes demonstrate a limited effect of temperature on the interface shear strength, with the interface friction angle decreasing by less than 3 %. With the same device of Brunelli (2022)92, Lupattelli et al. (2023)93 conducted another experimental campaign to determine the influence of temperature on the shear behaviour of sandy soil-concrete interface. Temperature-controlled, direct shear interface tests were carried out at normal stress values ranging from 25 to 100 kPa, and the results obtained for heated and non-heated interfaces were compared (constant thermal load of 30 ◦C vs. room temperature of 20 ◦C). The results showed an increase of about 12 % of friction angle of the heated interfaces with respect to the not-heated ones. Pan et al. (2022)116 carried out a series of temperature-controlled interface direct shear tests between sand and concrete, including different contents of fine-grained soil, to investigate this effect together with the temperature increase effect on the interface shear strength parameters. In general, small thermal effects were found on the interface shear stress versus shear displacement curve, with only a slight effect observed on the peak point. The interface shear strength was found to first decrease and then increase with the increase of temperature considering a content of fine-grained soil ≤11 %, attaining a minimum value at T = 40 ◦C. Instead, with a content of fine-grained soil > 11 %, the interface shear strength indices all increase with the increase of temperature. In other words, the fine-grained soil content seems to have a significant impact on the shear strength index of the interface: the friction angle of the interface decreases with the increase of fines content, while cohesion increases. Fig. 6 presents the collected results from TM interface behaviour research which reveal that in general, there is a very limited effect of temperature on the soil-concrete interface shear resistance, especially for coarse-grained soils. For fine-grained soils, most of the cited studies seem to suggest an improvement of the interface shear strength (through increased adhesion), as a consequence of increasing temperature, and in particular a strong dependency of the results on the interface roughness and stress history. In other investigations, no significant variation in interface behaviour due to temperature change were observed, regard­less of the soil type. In general, it can be stated that the differences found in the results can be likely linked to the multitude of experimental configurations, development protocols and composition of the samples used in the tests. Therefore, it is not always possible to deduce a univocal conclusion on the effect of heating at the soil-structure interface. 5. Discussion and conclusions Building upon the literature discussed above, some challenges and perspectives related to the thermally induced behaviour of interfaces between soil and EGs can be identified, whose achievement would contribute to fostering the use of these structures in the practice. Indeed, although the single literature works seem to demonstrate consensus in some findings, many observations are still conflicting, with reference to the interface behaviour of fine-grained soil behaviour. Regarding the broadly unambiguous evidence, the following observations can be made:  • The direct effect of temperature on sand-structure interfaces is negligible.  • Cyclic thermal loading (as opposed to monotonic one) has no discernible impacts on the mechanical properties of the interface.  • Any dependency of the interface behaviour on temperature changes is on the safe side. On the other hand, despite the progress made, other aspects of the understanding of the TM behaviour of interfaces remain incomplete and sometimes contradictory, particularly for fine-grained soil. Most of the studies agree in observing the relationship between the influence of temperature on the clay-concrete interface and the effect of roughness. For example, studies such as the ones provided by Di Donna et al. (2016)1 and Maghsoodi et al. (2019)91 showed that the effect of a Table 3 Details of the literature investigation of the effect of temperature changes on the shear strength of soil-structure interface.

However, from the practical point of view, when calculating the bearing capacity of EGs, the interface friction angle is considered while any adhesion is neglected. Therefore, a slight decrease of the strength of interfaces with fine-grained soils for increasing in temperature would arise, due to the decrease in the angle of shearing resistance. On the other hand, the actual increase in the shear strength of the considered interfaces with temperature by means of the contribution of the adhe­sion supports the use of a constant value of interface angle of shear strength, as determined at room temperature, in bearing capacity formulations. So far, the inconsistencies that emerged from the experimental in­vestigations can be mostly related to the multitude of experimental setups, protocols and materials which prevents a consistent and objec­tive assessment of the role of the influential variables. This strongly reduces the comparability of the different studies and can lead to apparently conflicting results. For example, currently there is no agreed standard heating protocol in use, potentially resulting in transiently undrained conditions, rate effects and temperature gradients that might influence the thermally induced deformation of soil. Particular attention should be devoted to using specifically modified and calibrated in­struments to eliminate, or adequately account for, possible artefacts related to the test boundary conditions. Further research needs to be performed to understand the TM behaviour at the interface, including the role of a thermal zone of influence in the soil around the interface. Presently, the lack of standards and interpretation procedures is one of the major issues preventing the extension of EGs technology from aca­demic research and experimentation to the industry. The development of standard testing methods and equipment specifically designed for practical engineering purposes can foster the use of this technology.

Numerous efforts are therefore being made to resort to the use of technologies that allow the use of clean energy. The heat contained in the most superficial layers of the Earth’s crust, called Low Enthalpy Geothermal Energy (LEGE), represents one of the most common forms of renewable energy, and this resource can be effectively exploited in various applications. For instance, Energy Geostructures (EGs)3, exploit LEGE by incorporating the primary heat exchangers of ground source heat pump systems in structural elements that are in contact with the ground (e.g., piles, retaining structures, tunnel linings). Due to their dual role, in addition to mechanical loading, EGs are subjected to cyclic thermally induced de­formations, during heat injection and extraction processes. The thermal deformations of steel, reinforced concrete and soil are different, due to differences in the Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of each ma­terial and therefore, even if temperature variations across the materials are small, significant changes in the soil-structure interface behaviour may occur. The thermal deformations are more relevant the higher the ratio between the coefficients of thermal expansion of the geostructure and the ground, and this is a potential concern in quantifying the me­chanical performance of EGs4,5. How concrete responds to temperature change depends on the relative proportions of its constituent materials – the aggregate mineralogy, mix proportions, moisture content and the like. In normal weight concrete, such as would be used in foundations, the aggregate used, as the major material component, dominates the final value of the thermal property being considered. Typical values for the CTE of aggregates such as limestone, granite and quartzite are 4.0–6.5 με/K, 5.4–9.0 με/K and 11–12.6 με/K, respectively6,7. Overall, however, the CTE of concrete is slightly larger than just that for the aggregate due to the influence of the cement paste, i.e., 6.1–8.5 με/K, 8.6–10.4 με/K and 12.2–13.7 με/K for limestone, granite, and quartzite-based concretes, respectively6,7. Granular soils will exhibit CTE values which are similar to those indicated above for aggregates, again as a function of the particle mineralogy. In the case of thermally activated (TA) piles, it is important to consider the effect of heat flow to understand when the most critical design situations can occur. Significant changes in the mobilized shaft resistance, pile axial displacement and axial load due to thermal loads have been highlighted, but they are not expected to lead to negative consequences in terms of the mechanical response of the piles except in a few specific cases, such as that of large pile spacing and high initial shaft resistance mobilization under mechanical load8,9. Other studies showed that, in the case of isolated TA pile, the maximum stress changes occur at the beginning of the first thermal cycle and that the change in pile head settlement will increase throughout the thermal cycle as the hea­ting/cooling front penetrates the soil mass5,10. However, ensuring that a small contribution of available shaft strength is not mobilized after the application of the mechanical loading has been shown to be sufficient to ensure that unrecoverable settlements developed over cycles are limited8. Therefore, considering the significance of available pile shaft resistance mobilization, developed in contact with the soil, the problem of soil-pile interface role becomes of interest. Variations of the normal effective stresses induced by thermal behaviour of the soil and concrete, that expand and contract, could possibly bring about negative conse­quences on the pile shaft resistance, due to the cumulated relative slip at the interface between the two materials, as found for example in the numerical investigation of Suryatriyastuti et al. (2014)11, who consider the possibility that cyclic shearing could lead to “friction fatigue” on a hypothetical basis. Furthermore, it is worth considering the interrela­tionship between the Thermo-Hydro-Mechanical (THM) behaviour of the soil and the soil-structure interface, especially under saturated and partially saturated conditions and in a fine-grained soil matrix, in which thermal loading could induce excess pore water pressure, leading to consolidation and irreversible volume change12. The behaviour of soil and TA piles under thermal loading has received significant scientific attention in recent years, and several reviews have been published, with reference to laboratory and in situ testing, and numerical modelling. Gens (2010)13 provides an in-depth discussion on the complexity arising from the interaction between soil and the environment, and the thermal behaviour of soil for the two cases of high temperature (storage of high-level radioactive waste) and low temperature (frozen ground) conditions. Laloui et al. (2014)14 present an overview on the THM behaviour of soils and how they could affect the performance of EGs, claiming that there are still opportunities to reach a mature understanding of fine-grained soil behaviour under THM loading by distinguishing different soil types, mineralogy, over-consolidation ratio (OCR), and drainage conditions during heating and shearing. Christodoulides et al. (2020)15 provide an overview on the modelling aspects of shallow geothermal energy systems, focusing on the most relevant analytical and numerical methods used in the inves­tigation of their coupled THM behaviour. Loveridge et al. (2020)16 re­view recent approaches for both in situ and full-scale testing and model scale experiments of EGs. It emerges from this work that to reproduce the TM behaviour of TA piles, a range of different constitutive re­lationships for the energy pile, soil, and interface must be included, as well as considering different physical processes such as heat flow, and thermally induced pore water flow. Rotta Loria & Coulibaly (2021)12 pointed out the unresolved issues regarding thermally induced soil deformation and discussed the challenges and engineering opportunities that can result from the deepening of knowledge about the non-isothermal behaviour of fine- and coarse-grained soils. To reproduce and to verify the experimental evidence by means of numerical modelling, a number of studies employing either the finite element or finite difference methods have been reported4,11,17–33. These studies were performed to examine the mechanical and thermo-mechanical (TM) behaviour of EGs, considering a range of different constitutive relationships for the structural and geo-materials involved. So far, numerical modelling to predict the TM behaviour of EGs has mainly focused on the thermally-induced stress and strain changes within the modelled geostructures19,25,26,29,32,33. Only a few works have examined the role of the interface behaviour in the response of EGs, specifically TA piles27,28,34–36, and how this could affect their safety and serviceability. Different assumptions have been explored in the literature for interface constitutive behaviour, starting from its purely mechanical characterization. To model interfaces, one of the following assumptions is typically made:  • Approach 1. The pile and soil are rigidly connected with a perfectly rough interface and failure occurs through the elements closest to the interface, and resistance is governed by the soil shear strength pa­rameters. When this approach is used, care is required to ensure the elements closest to the structure are thin, so that shearing occurs as close to the interface as possible (2001)37;  • Approach 2. Shear failure occurs at the interface, where zero- thickness joint elements are introduced on the pile-soil interface, to which suitable constitutive relationships are assigned38–40. With the introduction of these elements, the mesh refinement close to the structure is not so significant. For the analysis of TA foundations, several methods have been adopted to model the interface behaviour (summarized in Table 1). Many assume that the pile and soil are rigidly connected with a perfectly rough interface, i.e., Approach 1 above. Laloui et al. (2006)35 modelled the contact between pile shaft and soil as perfectly rough with a refined finite element mesh, thus avoiding introducing interface elements. Sal­ciarini et al.

Anongphouth et al. (2018)41 discretized the pile-soil interface with a very fine mesh, as well as around the pile toe imposing for all analyses the equality between the soil strength and that of the interface zone. Most modern numerical models for pile-soil interaction use interface elements based on the joint element concept (i.e., Approach 2 above), first introduced by Goodman et al. (1968)42, which utilise an element of zero thickness formulated basing on the relative displacements of solid elements adjacent to the interface. Boulon & Nova (1990)43 were among the first authors to present a constitutive law for interface mechanical behaviour suitable to analyse geostructures such as piles, comparing two constitutive laws belonging to different theoretical frameworks: an elastoplastic strain hardening model and an incremental law of rate type, showing that both may reproduce reasonably well the experi­mental results previously obtained by means of a specially conceived direct shear test. The former is a simple law appropriate for small dis­placements, while the latter seems to be more appropriate for large displacements. Ghionna & Mortara (2002)44 proposed an elastoplastic model for sand and rigid inclusions interface, basing the comparison of the prediction of the model on some experimental test results performed with the direct shear apparatus. Other authors define a thin layer of solid elements as the soil-pile interface, sometimes attributing to it greater or lesser resistance parameters than the surrounding soil, i.e., Approach 1 Table 1 Literature investigation of the effect of temperature increase on the deform­ability of soils.

Di Donna & Laloui (2015a)21 modelled the interface as a thin layer based on the Advanced Constitutive Model for Environmental Geomechanics-Thermal (ACMEG-T), but using effect, using for the interface constitutive parameters of the soil. Fei & Dai (2018)34 modelled the soil-pile interface as a layer of thin elements for which the constitutive parameters were taken as the same as those for the sur­rounding soil, while Ng & Sritharan (2015)45 used a smaller interface friction angle, reduced with respect to the soil one. Han & Yu (2022)28 represented the soil-pile interface with a thin elastic layer, for which the displacement of pile and soil were decoupled and connected by an elastic force with equal magnitude but opposite direction, through the modelling of a spring with stiffness calibrated to describe the friction resistance. Other solutions encountered in reading are, e.g., Surya­triyastuti et al. (2014)11, who used a bounding surface plasticity formulation based on the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, and Arzan­fudi et al. (2020)27 instead modelled the interface behaviour through a solid element able to reproduce the changes in soil volume and the slip at the pile-soil interface induced by the cyclic TM loading. It is not possible to assess whether the choice of the specific soil constitutive model influenced the soil-structure interaction predictions, but all the constitutive models used in the above listed studies resulted, reportedly, in a good quality of simulations in terms of predicted axial stresses and strains in the modelled EGs. However, the works discussed above focus on the modelling of the mechanical characteristics of the soil-structure interface, while little literature information is available regarding the thermal characterization of the interface. On this issue, Bourne-Webb et al. (2020)46 introduced a geo-contact thermal resis­tance (geo-CTR) parameter, to reproduce more reliable thermal per­formance and TM interactions of energy piles, describing a benchtop test method for measuring such parameter at the soil-structure interface. The geo-CTR was found to be influenced by, amongst other factors, geo­metric irregularities, surface microhardness and cleanliness, contact pressure, thermal conductivity of the solids at the contact and interstitial materials. Currently, although there exists a broad body of knowledge regarding the influence of temperature variations on the behaviour of soil, a significant knowledge gap regarding thermally induced effects on the soil-structure interface remains, especially from the experimental point of view. Several experimental devices with temperature control and different tests have been proposed to investigate the response of soil-structure interface under cyclic and monotonic, mechanical, and thermal loads. Further, there appears to be quite a variety of adopted investigation techniques, boundary conditions and testing procedures, which has potentially led to imprecise and non-unique conclusions in the interpretation of such testing. Based on the foregoing considerations, this paper offers a critical review of the recent literature focused on the soil-structure interface behaviour under thermal loads. The work is motivated by the need to provide an updated account of the current knowledge that has been acquired on the subject, assessing knowledge gaps, and identifying possible future research perspectives to further broaden basic understanding and to develop design guidelines and standards for EGs. The paper is structured as follows: a brief outline of the THM effects induced in soil is provided in Section 2, with an emphasis on the possible causes of inconsistency between the various results that have been re­ported; in Section 3, the concept of interface between the soil and the EG is introduced and then, in Section 4, the state of the art regarding TM effects at the soil-structure interface is described, with reference to experimental results found in literature. In Section 5, a closing discus­sion that highlights the current scientific challenges concludes the paper. 2. Thermo-hydro-mechanical effects induced in soil The heat exchange provided by EGs can affect both the soil and the foundation structure response, modifying its stress and strain field, and potentially, the soil–structure interface mechanical behaviour. Conse­quently, there is a potential for detrimental impact of temperature changes on the performance of EGs in terms of elastic or plastic de­formations and bearing capacity ——14—. In this Section, a brief over­view of the effects that thermal loads induce in soil in terms of deformability, development of excess pore water pressures and shear strength are reported. The purpose of this Section is to outline basic phenomena observed during experimental investigations on soils that may be relevant in the analysis of interface behaviour, without going into detail about individual aspects, for which one can refer to the cited publications. 2.1. Thermal induced volume changes and effect of temperature on soil deformability To understand the effect of thermal loads on soil deformability, numerous experimental results obtained from temperature-controlled oedometer and triaxial tests and reported in the literature have been reviewed in Table 1. Rotta Loria & Coulibaly (2021)12 provided an exhaustive review of the effects of thermal loads on deformability and volumetric changes, summarizing the following general findings for fine-grained soils:  • In normally consolidated (NC) states (Fig. 1a), fine-grained soils contract when heated, with a significant part of the deformation remaining irrecoverable upon cooling, highlighting an irreversible (thermo-elasto-plastic) behaviour47–52.  • In highly over-consolidated (OC) states (Fig. 1a), fine-grained soils expand when heated, with deformation recovered upon cooling, highlighting a reversible (thermo-elastic) behaviour53–57. In the literature, the magnitude of the reversible and irreversible parts of the volume change have been identified as depending mainly on the soil type, soil plasticity, stress history, degree of saturation, rate of heating/cooling and drainage conditions12.  • Under slightly to moderately OC states (Fig. 1a), fine-grained soils seem to expand initially (thermo-elastically) and then contract (thermo-elasto-plastically) when heated. This is consistent with a thermo-elasto-plastic constitutive framework involving thermal de­pendency of the hardening law58.  • Different behaviours may be observed in presence of very high temperatures up to 100 ◦C59–61, or when soils are subjected to large thermal loading rates62,63, potentially leading to temporarily un­drained conditions and the occurrence of excess pore water pres­sures. In some cases, where the OCR is large, an increase in temperature is observed to cause soil expansion when the soil has been unloaded from NC conditions, while soil contraction is reported when it has been reloaded from a previously higher OCR. This could depend on the void ratio variations, as the rearrangement of particles during heating is responsible for most of the volume deformations. In fact, Burghingoli et al. (2000)62 found that void ratio changes, in value and sign, are dependent on the mechanical stresses experi­enced by the soil during the recent stress history: if mechanical reloading precedes heating, the soil tends to contract, while if me­chanical unloading occurs prior to heating, the soil tends to dilate. Studies on coarse-grained soils (Fig. 1b), such as fine sands64,65 show that compressibility parameters such as compression index, elastic modulus and OCR are independent of temperature. The variation of volumetric strain with temperature increase in these soils has been the subject of several studies. Ng et al. (2016)51 show an irreversible heating contraction under loose to very dense conditions, followed by a subse­quent expansion at higher temperatures while, on the contrary, Sitti­dumrong et al. (2019)66 show only expansion upon heating. Other results from Liu et al. (2018)67 show only expansion upon heating under dense conditions and suggest that the relative density (Dr) — could be a useful parameter to assess the thermal impact on the induced volume A. Lupattelli et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ```"

In addition, Pan et al. (2020)68 claimed that the confining stress level may also control the volumetric expansion for all relative densities: the magnitude of heating contraction of coarse-grained soils seems to increase with the applied stress level51. 2.2. Effect of temperature on hydraulic soil conditions Thermal loads may induce changes in pore water pressures and in the water flow regime in soils, and the hydraulic conditions may equally affect the thermal field, since the pore fluids conduct and transport heat73. All three main heat transfer processes can occur in soils: con­duction (usually the dominant process, in the absence of groundwater flow), convection and radiation. For soils, Fig. 2 illustrates the condi­tions where natural convection and radiation may also occur and become significant depending on the soil grain size and the degree of saturation of the considered soil. In this schematic, “forced” convection brought about by groundwater flow is not considered, but it should be remarked that this may become a dominant heat exchange process for high-permeability (coarse-grained) materials in the presence of a mov­ing aquifer. It is relevant to consider how thermal loading affects the hydraulic conditions: moisture migration is one example of TH coupling of un­saturated soil behaviour, and it also changes the thermal properties of the soil, by affecting phase proportions. Heating processes can also cause pore water evaporation and the water vapor will then be susceptible to vapor pressure gradients and will migrate through the soil to an area of lower vapor pressure73. Here, the temperature may also be lower, and the vapor would then condense, thus releasing the latent heat in a new location. Farouki (1981)74 suggested that the movement of moisture may be important in fine-grained unsaturated soils (Fig. 2) and Hell­strom (1991)75 suggested that this phenomenon becomes significant in high porosity soils of low saturation when the temperature is above 25 ◦C. Under operating conditions for EGs, the heat carrier fluid could reach 30 ◦C, although several experiments were carried out at greater and lower temperatures. Soil permeability and soil compressibility were found to be the most significant variables affecting the development of excess pore water pressures76: in soils with low permeability, tempera­ture increase may lead to an increase of pore water pressures and, therefore, strength and stiffness could be affected. For high permeability soils, the phenomenon is less relevant with regard to pore water pres­sures48,58. The main mechanisms that lead to generation of excess pore water pressures depend on the THM properties and condition of the soil77. Typically, thermal pressurization may be caused by differential thermal expansion between pore water and the solid skeleton under (partially) undrained conditions. This phenomenon becomes more relevant when NC clayey soils undergo thermo-elasto-plastic loading, implying thermal contraction for the solid skeleton while pore water exhibits thermal expansion. However, in shallow geothermal problems, the usual magnitude of soil temperature changes and rate of thermal loading can be considered small enough to avoid appreciable thermal pressurization effects. 2.3. Effect of temperature on the soil shear strength Some of the basic issues regarding the response of soils subjected to thermal loads, starting from the pioneering works on underground nu­clear waste storage, have been dealt with over the last few decades through laboratory testing. The most used laboratory equipment to assess the influence of thermal loads on the soil shear strength parameters are temperature-controlled triaxial and direct shear devices. Most studies have focused on the TM behaviour of fine-grained soils47,48,53,58, 62,70,71,78–89, and few works have investigated the thermal effects on coarse-grained soils49,89–91. Some authors argue that the shear strength parameters of coarse- grained soils such as sand are less sensitive to variations in thermal load than those of fine-grained soils. In fact, some published experi­mental results show that the effect of temperature on the angle of shearing resistance of coarse-grained soils is quite small, as shown in  Fig. 3. Yavari et al. (2016)89 pointed out a ductile failure type with the same values of friction angles for two different temperatures (20 and 40 ◦C) and almost cohesionless sandy soil. Maghsoodi et al. (2019)91 observed a brittle failure type with the same peak and residual friction angles in two sandy specimens at two temperature levels (22 and 60 ◦C), showing the negligible effect of thermal variations on the strength parameters of sand. Brunelli (2022)92 conducted an experimental campaign to deter­mine the influence of temperature on the shear strength parameters of samples of silty sand using a temperature-controlled shear box — apparatus, at normal stress values ranging from 25 to 100 kPa. By comparing the results obtained for heated and non-heated samples (constant thermal load of 30 ◦C vs. room temperature of 20 ◦C), a limited effect of the temperature variation on the soil friction angle was observed, with a slight value decrease from 40◦to 38◦with heating. Following the same procedure and test apparatus of Brunelli (2022)92, Lupattelli et al. (2023)93 tested other sandy soil samples, showing fric­tion angle slight increases from 43.6 to 44.6◦, deemed negligible. For fine-grained soils, at first glance, conflicting results are reported in the literature, as reported by Laloui et al. (2014)14 and Yavari et al. (2016)89. In fact, clay’s friction angle is observed in many works to either slightly decrease or increase with temperature, as shown in Fig. 3. Overall, no consistent trend is apparent, and the detected potential variation of soil friction angle with temperature typically appears to be very limited, in agreement with the conclusions of Yavari et al. (2016)89. In terms of available shear strength, the observations of Kunti­wattanakul et al. (1995)80, later confirmed by Graham et al. (2001)84, tried to provide guidance to understand the temperature dependency of shear strength for heated clay. One of the key remarks is the importance of distinguishing between the results of drained and undrained heating tests: while drained heating was found to cause strengthening in clay, undrained heating was found to cause weakening. Sherif & Burrous (1969)94 were among the first researchers to conduct undrained triaxial tests, highlighting a reduction in undrained shear strength of clay with increasing temperature (for tests carried out at 20 and 60 ◦C). With the same test setup but at higher temperatures (70–90 ◦C), Moritz (1995)78 and Hueckel & Baldi (1990)53 showed some decrease in peak undrained shear strength upon heating of clay. Conversely, Tanaka et al. (1997)83 showed that while at large strain the shear strength envelope is almost independent of temperature, the peak undrained strength slightly increases with temperature for NC speci­mens, as for Burghignoli et al. (2000)62. Kuntiwattanakul et al. (1995)80 and Graham et al. (2001)84 also observed that for NC clay, under drained heating conditions, the shear strength and stiffness increase for heated specimens, whereas for OC clay, the shear strength is not significantly affected by temperature changes. Cekerevac & Laloui (2004)58 showed, for NC clay specimens and drained heating conditions, higher peak shear strength with increasing temperature and the same critical state strength compared with specimens sheared at room temperature, while confirming that this effect is less relevant for OC heated samples. Yavari et al. (2016)89 observed, for clay at 20 and 40 ◦C heated under drained conditions, quite small effects on the shear strength without a clear trend. Moreover, Laloui & Rotta Loria (2019)95 claim that the shear strength of fine-grained soils under non-isothermal loading conditions depends on the temperature-stress path: when an OC soil is sheared at high temperature and reaches the yield limit at a lower deviatoric stress with respect to shearing at the initial temperature, the main conse­quence is thermal softening; conversely, a NC or slightly OC heated soil results in a combination of thermal softening and strain hardening, which tend to balance each other. At the same time, according to A. Lupattelli et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ```"

(2000)62, Hong et al. (2013)87 and Hamidi et al. (2014)88, much of the thermal dependence is attributed to the soil mineralogy. In fact, some experimental investigations showed a slight thermal dependency for kaolin clay (Cekerevac & Laloui, 2004)58, whereas the shear strength of illite84 and smectite clay53,62 were found to be independent of temperature. Coming to a single interpretation on the variation in available soil shear strength at different temperatures is not straightforward because the framework of the existing experimental evidence is very complex, due to the large variability of testing initial and boundary conditions, soil mineralogy and loading history, and variability of types of testing apparatus. Based on the above arguments, the shear strength of soil cannot be fully considered as independent of temperature96, despite the relatively small temperature changes97,98 that are typical of EGs Fig. 3.

The above discussion of the state-of-the-art is summarized in the following Table 2, extracted from Laloui et al. (2014)14 and updated with more recent studies. 3. Definition of soil-structure interface The soil–structure interface is defined as the thin zone of soil adja­cent to the structure and its thickness depends on both the soil and surface properties of the structure50, e.g., the interface is typically considered as having a thickness about 10 times the mean diameter D50 of the soil grains99–103. In particular, the pioneering study of Mühlhaus & Vardoulakis (1987)99 demonstrated, resorting to Cosserat’s theory for granular materials, that the thickness of shear bands is a small multiple of the soil’s mean grain size, while Rattez et al. (2017, 2018)102,103 defined this thickness zone using Linear Stability Analysis (LSA), allowing to explore qualitatively the influence of various soil parameters such as the grain size, hardening modulus, friction and dilatancy angles, thermal pressurization coefficient, normal stress, porosity, and permeability. Different deformation mechanisms occur at the soil-structure inter­face: shearing of the soil and sliding between the soil particles and the interface, involving a relative displacement between the two mate­rials104 ( Fig. 4). Tsubakihara et al. (1993)105 proposed a classification, also supported by De Jong et al. (2003)106, for the soil-pile interface behaviour into three failure modes with specific relationships, depending on the structure roughness. By identifying the maximum vertical distance be­tween the highest and lowest peaks of the structure asperities Rmax over a fixed length107, and the soil mean grain size (D50), a normalized roughness Rn = Rmax/D50 is defined. Upon identifying a critical value of roughness Rc, depending on the materials and interface conditions, the following can be stated:  • If the surface roughness of the structure, Rn < Rcr, the interface is considered smooth, relative sliding occurs between the two materials and the response can be generally considered elastic-perfectly plastic.  • If Rn > Rcr, the interface is considered rough, shear failure occurs in the soil, its behaviour approximates that of the soil and can be ana­lysed using the framework of the critical state theory108.  • When Rn is close to Rcr, shear failure and sliding displacement occur simultaneously. An extensive body of knowledge relating to soil-structure interface behaviour has been developed which has been fundamental to the development of design methods for geotechnical structures, especially deep foundations. However, this understanding was developed for conventional and offshore piled foundations and not for TA piles. For the latter, an additional factor must be considered, namely the temperature changes in the materials which could alter their strength and deforma­tion characteristics. The temperature variations may produce changes in normal stress (and available shearing resistance) due to radial de­formations. They may also alter the mobilised shear at the interface109, through the axial deformations, forces and, especially when cyclic, may lead to possible changes in the interface material characteristics and to particle rearrangement. Based on these considerations, it can be stated that the multi-physical nature of the loads, together with the couplings that govern the behaviour of the materials involved, makes the THM behaviour of EGs complex and the role of the soil-structure interface takes on relevance for the analysis and design of EGs. Understanding the behaviour of soil- structure interfaces is thus crucial and the present review aims to analyse it for the EGs in general, but more significantly for those geotechnical structures wherever the interface behaviour plays a key role such as— foundation piles. 4. Mechanical and thermal effects at the interface This section provides an overview of the experimental evidence relating to the thermally induced response at the soil-structure interface for both fine- and coarse-grained soils: the laboratory equipment, ma­terials and test methodologies used in different investigations are described and used to compare and revise the different results. 4.1. Test equipments The test equipment used to investigate interface TM behaviour typically involves bespoke modifications to allow the application of thermal loads between the soil sample (fine- or coarse- grained) and the structure (concrete or steel) together with the application of the me­chanical load (see, e.g., Fig. 5). Most of the mentioned tests were performed using modified direct shear devices. Di Donna et al. (2016)1 re-designed the lower part of the shear box to introduce the thermal system, consisting of electrical resistance (heating tissue) placed between two layers of woven glass fibre, impregnated with silicon elastomer, and installed under the con­crete sample. Equally, Brunelli (2022)92 and Lupattelli et al. (2023)93 used a classic shear box implemented with a concrete plate equipped with thermal resistance (silicon heating mat), that heats the soil sample. Ravera et al. (2020)110 modified the lower part of the shear box by opening holes on its wall, introducing water circulation. Also, a thermal bath was attached to the circulation tubes to ensure the target temper­atures of the circulating water. Yavari et al. (2016)89 realized the heating system by accommodating in an insulated shear box container a copper tube, immersed in water, within which water with controlled temperature circulates. Similarly, Xiao et al. (2019)111 and Yazdani et al. (2019)112 replaced the lower shear box with a concrete plate that has embedded tubes connected to two refrigerated and heated circulating baths to apply cooling and heating. Vasilescu et al. (2019)113 installed the shear box in a container filled with water for simulating saturated conditions and applied the thermal loading through a closed loop circuit installed under the container and connected to a refrigerated heating circulator bath with air-cooled cooling machine, whereas Maghsoodi et al. (2019)91 placed the box inside a container with the heating system consisting of a heater that controlled the fluid temperature circulating in the lower part of the container. Unlike the abovementioned authors, to make the test more representative of the actual conditions of the TA piles, Li et al. (2021)114 used a triaxial pressure chamber, and the temperature-controlled soil-structure interface was realized by placing a cylindrical structure inside the soil specimen and connecting them to two individual heat transfer systems, one set for heating and the other one to produce a constant thermal boundary condition near the outer edge of the soil specimen. 4.2.

The first comprehensive testing program was developed by Di Donna et al. (2016)1, who investigated the soil-concrete interface behaviour in fully drained conditions for Bernasconi grey quartz sand and NC Illite clay, to understand the influence of several factors, such as concrete surface roughness, temperature (up to 60 ◦C) and confinement condition normal to the interface (constant normal load (CNL) or constant normal stiffness (CNS)). The device used for the experiments was a direct shear box modified to reproduce the soil-structure interface conditions under TM loading with temperature changes, and both shearing and heating rates were set to ensure drained conditions. The experiments demon­strated that temperature increases do not affect sand–concrete interface behaviour, which is explainable by the thermo-elastic behaviour of sandy soils. On the other hand, tests involving NC clay–concrete inter­face showed an increase of shear strength with temperature. Moreover, a slight decrease of the friction angle was observed but the most signifi­cant result was an increase of the adhesion between the clay and the concrete, likely related to thermal consolidation of the clay70,117,118. The authors concluded that, especially in the framework of EGs such as TA piles, the temperature increase effect on the soil–structure interface is in favour of safety: it is not relevant for sands, and it improves the overall interface strength in the case of NC clay. CNL and CNS interface tests were also conducted by Maghsoodi et al. (2019)91 on rough, NC Kaolin clay- and dense silica sand- steel interfaces through a modified direct shear test, at temperatures of 22 (ambient) and 60 ◦C. In the CNS tests, stiffness values of 500, 1000, and 5000 kPa/mm were used in the sand interface tests, and 1000 kPa/mm in the clay interface tests. All tests were carried out in saturated conditions. It was observed that for sand-structure interface tests the temperature did not change the interface mechanical behaviour for both CNL and CNS tests, and the friction angle did not change. On clay-structure interfaces, temperature did not affect the friction angle and the main effect was an increase of the interface peak adhesion. It should be remarked that un­like the above discussed works, steel was used in this case as the structural material. Since the nature of the structural material plays an important role in the behaviour of the interface, these results cannot be directly compared with the above ones. Yavari et al. (2016)89 conducted tests to investigate the shear behaviour of Kaolin clay-concrete interface. A conventional direct shear apparatus equipped with a temperature control system was used to test the interface behaviour at temperatures of 5 ◦C, 20 ◦C and 40 ◦C, constituting a possible range of operational temperatures observed in EGs. A slight decrease in shearing resistance with heating (i.e., “soft­ening behaviour”) was observed for the ultimate (i.e., post peak) strength. The effect of temperature on the shear strength parameters of the clay-concrete interface was considered negligible, with small variations of adhesion when temperature is changing from 5 ◦C to 40 ◦C, but without a very clear trend. The results of Yavari et al. (2016)89 lead to somewhat different conclusions from those reported by Di Donna et al. (2016)1, as the latter showed a hardening effect with higher adhesion corresponding to increasing temperature. The clay-concrete interface samples in Yavari et al. (2016)89 were, on the other hand, pre-consolidated and heated before the start of the test, and for this reason the effect of temperature on the clay-concrete interface, which is mainly related to thermal consolidation, is negligible. This may be a reasonable explanation on the apparently different effects of tempera­ture on the clay-concrete interface. Yazdani et al. (2017)112 conducted several direct shear tests, using a temperature controlled direct shear device to evaluate the effects of heating/cooling on soil–concrete interface shear strength, investigating the effects of stress state and history. The shearing behaviour of the Kaolin clay-concrete interface under thermal loading was found to be mainly controlled by the applied normal stresses and the stress history of clay (represented by OCR). Contrasting with the findings of Di Donna et al. (2016)1, the interface adhesion of the NC clay-concrete interface decreased slightly due to temperature increase, but nevertheless a gen­eral strengthening was found, with an increased peak friction angle at small displacements with heating cycles. This apparent difference be­tween the observations of Di Donna et al. (2016)1 and Yazdani et al. (2017)112 might be due to a different interpretation of the (linearized) peak strength envelopes. In addition, thermally induced hardening of the NC clay–concrete interface was found to be minor at a low normal stress while it was significant at higher normal stresses. On the other hand, thermally induced softening of the OC clay–concrete interface was observed as it was heated either monotonically or cyclically. The experimental program of Ravera et al. (2020)110 aimed to investigate the TM effects on NC clay-concrete interface subjected to cyclic heating in saturated conditions. In this study, some modifications were applied to the same direct shear device (described and used by Di Donna et al., 20161) by means of the introduction of holes in the lower part of the shear box, for the circulation tubes, and a thermal bath connected to the tubes to allow both heating and cooling. The experi­mental program was characterized by the following steps: saturation, consolidation under constant mechanical load, three thermal cycles on NC clay samples, monotonic shearing under CNS conditions at room temperature. The results show that there is no degradation of the shear strength of the interface and no significant changes in the effective normal stress when subjected to a few thermal cycles, and that changes in the failure envelope are negligible. Hashemi et al., (2023)115 investigated the shear behaviour of NC and OC kaolin clay and concrete interface in the practical temperature range of EGs (from 8 ◦C to 45 ◦C) through direct shear tests, following unloading/reloading paths to better comprehend the impact of thermal Fig. 5.

As TA piles are subjected to both thermal and mechanical loads, the behaviour on the soil-structure interface is particularly complex and is key for the analysis and design of these structures. The present paper aims to review the current state of knowledge regarding the thermal dependency of soil-structure interface behaviour and provide an overview of experimental results obtained from non-isothermal tests investigating soil and soil- structure interface behaviour. This overview includes comparison of the different experimental equipment and procedures, soil types, initial soil state overconsolidation ratio (degree of consolidation or relative density) and thermal loadings. It was found that it is not straightforward to reach a unique interpretation regarding possible variation of the soil-structure interface behaviour at different temperatures: the framework of the experimental evidence is very complex due to the wide variation in testing conditions. Therefore, it was not possible to compare the studies like-for-like, leading to an apparently ambiguous interpretation of the results. Overall, the consensus across this and other studies is that the potential variation of interface resistance with temperature typically appears to be limited and not very significant.   1. Introduction Problems involving interaction between the ground and structures, either resting on or embedded in the ground, are common in geo­technics. The interface between the ground and the structure is a thin soil layer where intense shear strain can occur, and shearing resistance with a friction and an adhesion component develops. For deep foundations, such as piles, the interface becomes important because the overall load-deformation response of these geostructures is influenced by the behaviour of the soil-structure interface1. Piles are employed to transfer mechanical loads, generated by the superstructure, to the ground through a combination of end-bearing resistance, on the pile base, and shearing resistance on the surface of the pile shaft. Spe­cifically, the shearing resistance on the shaft is mobilized when relative displacement occurs at the pile-soil interface, and the available resis­tance is a function of the adhesion and friction on the interface, which are related to the type of pile, installation technique and the type of soil2.

The original power lawrelation between the drained bulk/shear moduli and hydrate saturationis elaborated in.21,44 Note that hydrate saturation and fluid pressure,inclusive of the poromechanical effect, directly affect the stiffness ofthe formation. Without sufficient equivalent pore pressure, increasedeffective stress due to hydrate dissociation could lead to geomechanicalinstability.On the other hand, note that reservoir region is illustrated in black(see Fig. 8(b)) due to refined grids, considering the vertical hetero-geneity and very thin thickness of the hydrate composites. To improvecomputational efficiency from the original fine-scale single porositymodel, we employ the multiple porosity (MP) formulation, followingthe approach in.21 It allows us to use a vertically coarsened grid forgeomechanics (specifically, 160 × 35 in total).For Example 2, we compare the scaled model (for both the capil-lary pressure and permeability) and the non-scaled model, hereafterreferred to Scaled and Non-Scaled, respectively.

Yoon and J. Kimpressure, propagation of pressure diffusion in the Scaled appears to beaccelerated. As indicated in Figs. 9 (b) and (d), the differences betweenthe two models are attributed to the facilitated depressurization processin the Scaled model, influenced by the scaling factor (see Eq. (20)). Thisalso results in variations in gas inflow and hydrate dissociation rates.On the other hand, note that the Scaled model exhibits higher 𝑝𝐺rightabove the wellbore in the Overburden layer (Fig. 9 (a)), resulting fromenhanced gas inflow combined with the nearly undrained condition inthat region. From Fig. 9 (c), we verify a more vigorous endothermicprocess of the hydrate dissociation in the Scaled model.To investigate the evolution of capillary pressure and saturationsalong with relative permeability, we monitor the first hydrate layer,i.e., the sand layer located at a depth of −140.5 m (marked by thepurple diamond in Fig. 8(b)) near the wellbore region (up to 30 mradius). Fig. 10(a) reveals that the Scaled exhibits approximately threetimes higher capillary pressure levels compared to the Non-Scaledmodel, attributable to increased gas saturation. Additionally, the Scaledmodel demonstrates competing effects from hydrate dissociation (i.e.,pore-size effect) and gas saturation. At approximately 5 m from thewellbore (𝑟= 5 m in Fig. 10(c)), the Scaled model shows greaterdegree of hydrate dissociation from Day 5 onward, compared to theNon-Scaled model. Similarly, at this location, the highest gas saturationfor the Scaled model is observed on Day 10 (Fig. 10(b)). Meanwhile,the peak in 𝑃𝑐occurs on Day 5, followed by a decline as 𝑆𝐻decreasesover the period.In essence, the Scaled model exhibits the pore-sizeeffect (𝐴to 𝐴′ in Fig. 1) resulting from the change in hydrate saturation,i.e., reduced 𝑆𝐻. Before the pore-size effect becomes more dominant,an upward shift in 𝑃𝑐(𝐵to 𝐵′ in Fig. 1) is found from Day 5 toDay 10 near 𝑟= 10 m, which is attributable to the sharp increasein gas saturation from zero. While we note a decreasing trend in 𝑃𝑐and 𝑆𝐻over the period in the vicinity of the wellbore, these effectsextend further to the right end near 𝑟= 30 m for the remaining days.Consequently, the spatial distribution profiles of capillary pressure inthe Scaled model exhibit parabolic-type curves.Furthermore, Fig. 10(b) with the Scaled model reveals a plateauof approximately 𝑆𝐺= 0.06 from the wellbore up to about 2.5 mfor the entire production period. This suggests not only high mobilityof the gaseous phase but also its accumulation near the Overburden.Fig. 10(d) highlights considerable differences in gas relative perme-ability between the two models. The 𝑆𝐺in the Non-Scaled model islower than that in the Scaled model. When gas saturation converges to𝑆𝑖𝑟𝐺= 0.01, the relative permeability of gaseous phase becomes zero.Fig. 11 presents the production behaviors of the two models. Theflow rate and total amount of CH4 from the Scaled model are about 1.5and 2 times higher than those from the Non-Scaled model, respectively.It is worth noting that the ratio of water production to CH4 in theScaled model ismore reliable compared to the Non-Scaled model,considering results from experiments.23 We confirm that the Scaledmodel exhibits more dissociation of hydrates with increased mobilityof fluids. Therefore, prediction on fluid flow and productivity of gashydrate deposits can significantly depends on the scaling effects ofcapillary pressure and permeability.Geomechanical responses:Depressurization in the gas hydrate reservoirs may lead to sub-stantial vertical compressive effective stress in the hydrate layers,potentially causing compaction and subsidence. Fig. 12 illustrates thedistributions of effective stress and strain fields for both the Scaled andNon-Scaled models: (a) vertical effective stress (𝜎′𝑧𝑧) from the Scaled,(b) volumetric strain (𝜖𝑣) from the Scaled, and (c) volumetric strainfrom the Non-Scaled. A comparison of (b) and (c) reveals that thecompaction in the Scaled model is less pronounced near the wellborethan in the Non-Scaled model. This difference is attributed to a higherflow rate (as shown in Figs. 10 and 11) and a smaller pressure drop inthe Scaled model, indicative of poromechanical effects.Fig. 13 displays the evolution of vertical displacements at threedifferent locations (marked by blue circles in Fig. 8(b)): at depths of𝑧= −20 m, −138 m, and −159 m all at a radial distance of 𝑟= 0.03m. At 𝑧= −20 m, where fluid inflow absent, the Non-Scaled modelresults in smaller vertical displacement, suggesting that the Non-Scaledmodel might underestimate risk of subsidence and wellbore stability.However, more significant vertical displacements are observed near thereservoir region, between depths of −138 m and −159 m. It is evidentthat the Scaled exhibits less compaction with increased gas inflow inthe reservoir. Notably, at −138 m, near the BHP gauge, the Non-Scaledexperiences more substantial subsidence.5. ConclusionsCombined with coupled flow and geomechanics, this study demon-strates the significant impact of the scaled capillary pressure model ongas hydrate deposits. To enhance the precision of gas hydrate predic-tions, incorporating the scaled model within a rigorous formulation ofporosity and permeability, also coupled with geomechanics, is essential.We perform comparative analyses between non-scaled and scaledmodels under various parameters, considering two-way coupled flowand geomechanics. The scaled capillary pressure model is based on Lev-erett’s capillary function, which employs the scaling factor derived fromthe porosity-dependent permeability relation. Given that the scalingfactor reflects changes in porosity, it is vital to incorporate the scaledcapillary pressure in conjunction with coupled flow and geomechanics.Numerical tests are conducted for gas hydrate deposits using heatinjection (Example 1) and depressurization (Example 2) methods withsimplified boundary conditions. In both examples, tractions are appliedat the top boundaries and no-displacements on the remaining ones areimposed for geomechanics, while no-flow boundaries are maintainedfor fluid and heat. Note that gravity is concerned only for Example 2.1. The scaled capillary pressure model exhibits a non-monotonicbehavior due to two competing factors from changes in hydrate(pore-size) and gas saturation.2. The scaled capillary pressure model results in distinctive systemresponses in gas hydrate deposits, including variations in ini-tial capillary pressure, hydrate dissociation, fluid pressure, andgeomechanical responses.3. Enhanced fluid mobility resulting from the scaled capillarypressure causes greater fluctuations in aqueous, gas, and hy-drate saturations, along with non-monotonic capillary pressurebehavior. These effects are more pronounced with lower initialgas saturation and vary depending on the relative permeabilitymodels.4. Regarding depressurization scenario, the scaled model signifi-cantly differs from the non-scaled model in terms of productivityand geoemechanical responses. For the UBGH2-6 site, East Sea,South Korea, the scaled model predicts enhanced productivityand reduced compaction in the reservoir area, particularly nearthe wellbore.A limitation of this study is its theoretical or modeling approach tothe scaled capillary pressure dynamics (e.g., non-monotonic evolutions)and its coupling with geomechanics, aimed at field-wide applicationsand simulation studies. In this regard, this model requires validationwith further experimental results in both flow and geomechanics. Ad-ditionally, the study does not consider capillary pressure hysteresis.Considering that periodic depressurization can enhance productivityand geomechanical stability at the UBGH2-6 site,21 ongoing researchis focused on the study of capillary hysteresis in conjunction with thescaled capillary pressure model.CRediT authorship contribution statementHyun Chul Yoon: Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investi-gation, Methodology, Software, Writing – original draft, Writing –review & editing, Visualization.

Yoon and J. Kimimpact on geomechanical properties and stability.20,21 Hydrate disso-ciation, for instance, can remarkably alter stress distribution, leadingto reservoir deformation. In turn, reservoir geomechanics influencefluid and heat flow through changes in porosity and permeability,which contribute to variations in capillary pressure. Therefore, thistightly coupled processes between fluid-heat flow and geomechanics ingas hydrates necessitate precise modeling, especially when intertwinedwith capillary pressure change due to gas hydrate saturation.The primary goal of this research is to examine the scaled capillarypressure and its phenomenological evolutions, tightly coupled withflow and geomechanics in gas hydrate deposits. The scaled capillarypressure model is based on the Leverett model, and its scaling factorrelates pore-size to hydrate saturation. We adopt the van Genuchtenmodel as a reference for capillary pressure model. Despite the avail-ability of various simulators for gas hydrate deposits,22 we selectthe T+MAM simulator for numerical simulation as we have recentlyvalidated it with the experimental results.23 We employ the fixed-stress sequential method for T+MAM for robust and effective couplingof ROCMECH (geomechanics simulator) and TOUGH+HYDRATE (flowsimulator)24 as this approach ensures numerical stability and accu-racy in coupled flow and geomechanics.25,26 Furthermore, the equiv-alent pore pressure concept27 is employed for multiphase flow, whichyields mathematical well-posedness and numerical stability, even instrong capillarity.28 However, this study does not account yet for anyhysteresis behavior in capillary pressure.27,29In our numerical experiments, we apply two distinct methods tosimulate hydrate dissociation: heat injection and depressurization.Through the example of heat injection case study, sensitivity anal-ysis reveals unique non-monotonic behaviors of the scaled capillarypressure. This behavior contrasts with non-scaled capillary pressureresults and is attributed to the interplay of two competing factors.Furthermore, the flow variables evolution of the scaled model alsounveils poromechanical effects, such as the enhanced fluid mobilitywith increased (equivalent) pore pressure, resulting in notable ge-omechanical deformation around the wellbore such as dilation. Inthe depressurization case, a real field gas hydrates deposit located inthe Ulleung Basin, East Sea, South Korea is chosen and examined.Notably, the hydrate dissociation process is significantly facilitatedwhen employing the scaled capillary pressure model. During depres-surization and dissociation of hydrates, the scaled capillary pressurewith enhanced permeability results in distinctive responses of coupledflow and geomechanics. As changes in solid (hydrate/ice) saturation(e.g., dissociation, freezing) affect the porosity or gas saturation, thescaled capillary pressure model proves vital for more accurate modelingof gas hydrate deposits.2. Mathematical formulationFor accurate modeling of the flow and geomechanical responses,alongside the capillary pressure and solid phase deposition in gashydrate deposits, we employ thermo-poromechanics theory30 for fullycoupled flow and geomechanics. We begin by recapitulating the gov-erningequationsandconstitutiverelationsforthethermal–hydrological–mechanical (THM) processes in gas hydrates,and we introduce the scaled capillary pressure with a dynamic per-meability model.2.1. Governing equationsThe governing equation for geomechanics is based on the momen-tum balance with the quasi-static assumption:𝐃𝐢𝐯𝝈+ 𝜌𝑏𝒈= 𝟎,(1)where 𝝈is the total stress tensor and 𝐃𝐢𝐯is the divergence operator. 𝜌𝑏is bulk density and 𝒈is the gravity vector for the body force concerned.Based on the small strain theory with the infinitesimal transformation,we can derive the linearized strain tensor 𝝐, i.e., the symmetric gradientof displacement vector 𝒖,𝝐= 12 (𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝒖+ (𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝒖)𝑇),(2)where 𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝and 𝑇are the gradient and transpose operators, respec-tively. Structured on the mass balance in the gas hydrates, the govern-ing equation for fluid flow24 is𝑑𝑑𝑡∫𝛺𝑚𝑘𝑑𝛺+ ∫𝛤𝒇𝑘⋅𝒏𝑑𝛤= ∫𝛺𝑞𝑘𝑑𝛺,(3)where 𝑑(⋅)∕𝑑𝑡indicates the time derivative of a physical quantity (⋅)relative to the motion of the solid skeleton. 𝛺denotes mathematicaldomain with its boundary 𝛤, and 𝒏is the outward normal vector tothe boundary, 𝛤. The superscript 𝑘denotes a fluid component, and𝑚𝑘, 𝒇𝑘, and 𝑞𝑘are its mass, flux, and source/sink terms, respectively.The mass of the component 𝑘, i.e., 𝑚𝑘is expressed𝑚𝑘=∑𝐽=𝐴,𝐺,𝐻,𝐼𝜙𝑆𝐽𝜌𝐽𝑋𝑘𝐽, 𝑘≡𝑤, 𝑚,(4)where only two components (𝑘), i.e., water and methane, are consid-ered for mass in this study. Therefore, the hydrate is considered as justone possible phase of the CH4⋅H2O system. The subscript 𝐽denotesa fluid phase, and 𝑆𝐽, 𝜌𝐽, and 𝑋𝑘𝐽represent the fluid saturation,density, and mass fraction of component 𝑘in phase 𝐽, respectively.Four possible phases (𝐽) considered are: aqueous (𝐽= 𝐴), gaseous (𝐽=𝐺), hydrate (𝐽= 𝐻), and ice (𝐽= 𝐼), where the first two phasesare mobile, and the rest is immobile solid phase. Note that 𝜙is thetrue porosity relating the ratio of pore volume to bulk volume in thedeformed configuration.The flux term in Eq. (3) is expressed𝒇𝑘=∑𝐽=𝐴,𝐺(𝒘𝑘𝐽+ 𝑱𝑘𝐽),(5)where 𝒘𝑘𝐽and 𝑱𝑘𝐽are the convective and diffusive mass fluxes ofcomponent 𝑘in phase 𝐽, respectively. Two different equations are usedto describe the convective flow depending on the phase given by theDarcy’s law. For the gaseous phase, 𝒘𝑘𝐺is written𝒘𝑘𝐺= 𝑋𝑘𝐺𝒘𝐺, 𝒘𝐺= −(1 + 𝑘𝐾𝑝𝐺)𝜌𝐺𝑘𝑟𝐺𝜇𝐺𝒌(𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝑝𝐺−𝜌𝐺𝒈),(6)where 𝜇𝐺, 𝑘𝑟𝐺, 𝜌𝐺, and 𝑝𝐺are the viscosity, relative permeability,density, and pressure of the gaseous phase, respectively. 𝒌indicates theintrinsic permeability tensor, and 𝑘𝐾represents the Klinkenberg factor.For the aqueous phase, 𝒘𝑘𝐴is𝒘𝑘𝐴= 𝑋𝑘𝐴𝒘𝐴, 𝒘𝐴= −𝜌𝐴𝑘𝑟𝐴𝜇𝐴𝒌(𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝑝𝐴−𝜌𝐴𝒈),(7)where 𝜇𝐴, 𝑘𝑟𝐴, 𝜌𝐴, and 𝑝𝐴are the viscosity, relative permeability,density, and pressure of the aqueous phase, respectively. The diffusiveflow for each component in each phase is expressed𝑱𝑘𝐽= −𝜙𝑆𝐽𝜏𝐺𝐷𝑘𝐽𝜌𝐽𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐝𝑋𝑘𝐽,(8)where 𝜏𝐺and 𝐷𝑘𝐽are the gas tortuosity and hydrodynamic dispersioncoefficient of component 𝑘in phase 𝐽, respectively.For heat or energy in the gas hydrates,24 the energy balance isconsidered𝑑𝑑𝑡∫𝛺𝑚𝜃𝑑𝛺+ ∫𝛤𝒇𝜃⋅𝒏𝑑𝛤= ∫𝛺𝑞𝜃𝑑𝛺,(9)where the superscript 𝜃indicates the heat component. 𝑚𝜃, 𝒇𝜃, and 𝑞𝜃are then heat, flux, and source terms, respectively.

Accordingly, Eq.

Regarding the fluid and heat flow, the pressure andtemperature are specified at initial time as 𝑝|𝑡=0 = 𝑝0 and 𝑇|𝑡=0 =𝑇0. For the boundary condition of fluid and heat, we have 𝑝=̄𝑝(prescribed pressure) and 𝑇= ̄𝑇(prescribed temperature) on 𝛤𝑝and𝛤𝑇, respectively, and 𝒗⋅𝒏= ̄𝑣(prescribed volumetric flux) on 𝛤𝑣and𝒉⋅𝒏= ̄ℎ(prescribed heat flux) on 𝛤ℎ, where 𝒏is the outward unitnormal vector to the boundary, 𝜕𝛺. For geomechanics, the initial stressfield should satisfy the mechanical equilibrium reflecting the historyof stress paths. By definition, the initial displacements and strains areequal to zero. For the boundary condition of geomechanics, we have𝒖= ̄𝒖(prescribed displacement) on 𝛤𝑢and 𝝈⋅𝒏= ̄𝒕(prescribed traction)on 𝛤𝜎. For the mathematical well-posedness, we presume 𝛤𝑝∩𝛤𝑣= ∅,and 𝛤𝑝∪𝛤𝑣= 𝜕𝛺. And 𝛤𝑇∩𝛤ℎ= ∅, with 𝛤𝑇∪𝛤ℎ= 𝜕𝛺. Also, 𝛤𝑢∩𝛤𝜎= ∅,and 𝛤𝑢∪𝛤𝜎= 𝜕𝛺.2.2. Constitutive relationsFollowing Coussy’s work,27,30 the constitutive relations of thermo-poromechanics are expressed in incremental forms; the total stress 𝝈,reservoir porosity 𝛷, and entropy 𝑆in the coupled system are expressed𝛿𝝈= 𝗖𝑑𝑟∶𝛿𝜺−𝑏∑𝐽=𝐹𝑆𝐽,𝑒𝛿𝑝𝐽𝟏−3𝛼𝑇𝐾𝑑𝑟𝛿𝑇𝟏, 𝑆𝐽,𝑒=𝑆𝐽∑𝐽=𝐹𝑆𝐽,(16)𝛿𝛷= 𝑏−𝛷0𝐾𝑠∑𝐽=𝐹𝑆𝐽,𝑒𝛿𝑝𝐽+ 𝑏𝛿𝜖𝑣−3𝛼𝜙𝛿𝑇,(17)𝛿𝑆𝑠= 3𝛼𝑇𝐾𝑑𝑟𝛿𝜺𝑣−3𝛼𝜙∑𝐽=𝐹𝑆𝐽,𝑒𝛿𝑝𝐽+ 𝐶𝑠𝑇𝛿𝑇,(18)where 𝛿denotes variation relative to the motion of the solid skele-ton, and the Einstein’s notation is employed for summation. In Equa-tion (16), 𝜺is the linearized total strain tensor, and 𝑏is the Biotcoefficient in single phase flow. 𝐽= 𝐹encapsulates all fluid phasespresent in the system. The term 3𝛼𝑇is the volumetric thermal dilationcoefficient of the solid skeleton, while 𝐾𝑑𝑟is the isothermal drainedbulk modulus. The rank-2 identity tensor is represented by 𝟏. Eq. (17)introduces Lagrange’s porosity, 𝛷, defined by the ratio of the porevolume in the deformed configuration to the bulk volume in the refer-ence (initial) configuration. 𝜖𝑣is the total volumetric strain, 𝛷0 is theinitial porosity, and 𝐾𝑠is the intrinsic solid grain modulus. 𝛼𝜙is thecoefficient of thermal dilation related to porosity, which is typicallyconsidered negligible. In Eq. (18), 𝑆𝑠is identified as the entropy ofthe solid skeleton, and 𝐶𝑠as the volumetric heat capacity of the solidskeleton. In this study, the direct contribution to heat from deformationof geomechanics is not considered, as the heat source induced bydeformation is generally minimal due to substantial heat capacity ofrock. Consequently, the first term on the right in Eq. (18) is considerednegligible and can be omitted.2.3. Scaled capillary pressure and dynamic permeabilityTo examine the alteration in capillary pressure and its evolutionresulting from hydrate formation or dissociation, we introduce theconcept of scaled capillary pressure, which is contingent upon porosityvariations. During hydrate dissociation, an increase in pore volume pre-viously occupied by hydrate or ice can enlarge intrinsic permeability. Inthis context, the Leverett capillary pressure model is employed,24 whichrelates the capillary pressure to the absolute permeability and porosity:̄𝑃𝑐,𝑠=√𝛷∕𝛷ref√𝑘∕𝑘ref𝑃𝑐,ref,(19)where ̄𝑃𝑐,𝑠is the scaled capillary pressure of the Leverett model, 𝑘and𝛷are the permeability and reservoir porosity, respectively, and (⋅)refstands for the reference model. 𝑃𝑐,ref is the non-scaled capillary pressuremodel. Here, the scaled capillary pressure (𝑃𝑐,𝑠) can be defined withscaling factor, 𝜉, as follows:𝑃𝑐,𝑠= 𝑃𝑐,ref∕√𝜉, 𝜉= 𝑘∕𝑘ref𝛷∕𝛷ref.(20)Moreover, we employ a porosity-dependent permeability model in thisstudy,𝑘= 𝑘0 exp[𝛾1(𝛷𝛷0−1)] ( 𝛷𝑎−𝛷𝑐𝛷0 −𝛷𝑐)𝛾2,𝛷𝑎= 𝛷(1 −𝑆𝑠), 𝑆𝑠= 𝑆𝐻+ 𝑆𝐼,(21)where 𝛷0 is the initial or reference (Lagrangian) porosity and 𝛷𝑎isactual porosity filled with fluids. 𝑆𝑠is the solid phase saturation, 𝛷𝑐isthe critical porosity at which the permeability is practically reduced tozero, and 𝛾1 and 𝛾2 are experimentally determined parameters.From Eqs. (20) and (21), the effect of hydrate dissociation or forma-tion can be reflected and scaled via 𝛷𝑎. Because the scaling factor itselfis a strong function of 𝑆𝑠and reservoir porosity – which is consequentlyinfluenced by reservoir deformation – the scaled capillary pressure isinherently interconnected with coupled flow and geomechanics, andhydrate saturation.Fig. 1 depicts phenomenological shifts in capillary pressure in re-lation to gas and hydrate saturations during hydrate dissociation. Ini-tially, hydrate dissociation can enlarge pore-size and reduce capillarypressure, thereby shifting the capillary pressure curve (𝐴to 𝐴′ inFig. 1). In contrast, dissociation concurrently increases gas saturation,thereby augmenting capillary pressure (𝐵to 𝐵′ in Fig. 1). As the riseor fall of scaled capillary pressure is determined by both changes in gassaturation and the scaling factor 𝜉, the evolution of capillary pressureduring hydrate dissociation may not be monotonic.On the other hand, we revisit the concept of equivalent pres-sure (𝑝𝐸),27 employed herein for addressing strong capillarity.In atwo-phase flow system comprising aqueous and gas phases, capillarypressure can be defined based on the interfacial energy as follows:𝑃𝑐(𝑆𝐴) = −𝑑𝑈(𝑆𝐴)𝑑𝑆𝐴,(22)```"

Two circles, 𝐴and 𝐵, here represent two competing factors such that capillary pressure may decrease as 𝐴(to 𝐴′) due to expanded pore withthe hydrate dissociation (pore-size effect), or may increase as 𝐵(to 𝐵′) as gas saturation increases from the dissociation, i.e., the decrease of aqueous phase saturation. Note thatthe vice versa would be applied to hydrate formation.

Based on the interfacial energy, 𝑝𝐸isdefined as𝑝𝐸= ̄𝑝−𝑈,(23)where ̄𝑝= 𝑆𝐽𝑝𝐽is the Einstein notation for the average pore pressure.The concept of equivalent pore pressure yields a well-posed problembeingthermodynamicallyconsistent,particularlyforstrongcapillarity.27,28 However, the utilization of average pore pressure doesnot ensure well-posedness, and may lead to numerical instability. Ad-ditionally, the interfacial energy, 𝑈, can also be defined in incrementalform:𝛿𝑈=∑𝐽=𝐹𝑝𝐽𝛿𝑆𝐽,𝑒.(24)Note that Eq.

(25) impliesthat the porosity change (𝛿𝛷) can be induced by the variation inwater saturation (𝛿𝑆𝑤) as well as in gas pressure (𝛿𝑝𝐺). Therefore, thebehavior of capillary pressure during hydrate dissociation in the gashydrates exhibits a tightly coupled process of thermo-poromechanics.3. Numerical discretizationFor space discretizations, we employ the finite volume method(FVM) for fluid flow based on a piece-wise constant (P0) approxima-tion, while the finite element method (FEM) is used for geomechanicswith a piece-wise linear (Q1) approximation. For time discretization,we adopt the backward Euler method, widely applied in reservoirsimulation.31 For two-way coupled flow and geomechanics, ensuringunconditional numerical stability and high accuracy, we employ thefixed-stress sequential method.25,32 The fixed-stress method initiallysolves the non-isothermal flow problem implicitly, fixing the total stressrate while allowing variation in strain and displacement fields. Subse-quently, the geomechanics problem is then implicitly solved. Owingto the strong nonlinearity in both simulators, the Newton–Raphsonmethod is employed for each problem.Using the fixed-stress method, the reservoir porosity function and itscorrection (Eq. (17)) can easily be calculated26 when the flow problemis solved:𝛷𝑛+1 −𝛷𝑛={𝑏2𝐾𝑑𝑟+ 𝑏−𝛷0𝐾𝑠}⏟⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏟⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏞⏟𝛷0𝑐𝑝∑𝐽=𝐹𝑆𝑛+1𝐽,𝑒(𝑝𝑛+1𝐽−𝑝𝑛𝐽)+ (3𝛼𝑇𝑏+ 3𝛼𝜙) (𝑇𝑛+1 −𝑇𝑛) −𝛥𝛷,(26)𝛥𝛷=𝑏2𝐾𝑑𝑟∑𝐽=𝐹𝑆𝑛𝐽,𝑒(𝑝𝑛𝐽−𝑝𝑛−1𝐽)+ 3𝛼𝑇𝑏(𝑇𝑛−𝑇𝑛−1) −𝑏(𝜀𝑛𝑣−𝜀𝑛−1𝑣) ,(27)where 𝑐𝑝denotes the pore compressibility for the uncoupled flowsimulation, and the superscript 𝑛indicates the time level. The porositycorrection term, 𝛥𝛷, can then correct the inconsistency of the porosity,estimated from the pore compressibility of the uncoupled flow problem,via considering the strain from geomechanics. As 𝛼𝜙is negligible, weconsider 𝛼𝜙= 0. From the porosity correction, the physical behavior oftightly coupled flow and geomechanics (e.g., the Mandel–Cryer effect)can be captured. It is worth noting that the mixed space discretization(Q1P0) with the fixed-stress sequential method yields spatial numericalstability although FEM with the same-order of approximation for bothflow and geomechanics may cause spatial oscillations.334. Numerical experimentsIn this section, we conduct numerical investigation of the scaledcapillary pressure and its evolution caused by hydrate dissociation.We use T+MAM,23 a simulator recently developed and validated forgas hydrate experiments for two-way coupled flow and geomechanicssimulations. T+MAM consists of TOUGH+HYDRATE24 for simulatingnon-isothermal multiphase multicomponent fluid and heat flow, andROCMECH34 for geomechanics simulation. These simulators respec-tively utilize FVM and FEM for spatial discretizations.33 T+MAM isbased on the fixed-stress sequential method for coupling between thesesimulators, employing the backward Euler method for time discretiza-tion.```"

Example 1: Heat injectionFor the heat injection, a 2D synthetic field with homogeneousproperties is established.

Given the absence of residual stress,no initial strain/displacement or effective stress is present. Note thattensile stress is regarded as positive.

[Test 1] Comparison between the two models, i.e., Case-Ref (Scaled) and Non-Scaled, is performed via subtraction of Non-Scaled model ((⋅)𝑁𝑆) from Scaled ((⋅)𝑆, Case-Ref))near the wellbore after 1 day heat injection: (a) 𝑝𝐺, (b) 𝑆𝐺, (c) 𝑇, and (d) 𝑆𝐻. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to theweb version of this article.)Case-Ref, the pressure tends to escalate due to the scaling factor, poten-tially leading to dilation. However, the system response, encompassingboth flow and geomechanics aspects, exhibits localized and temporalcomplexity (e.g., non-monotonic behavior of capillary pressure) overthe simulation, attributable to strongly coupled nonlinear systems ofnon-isothermal multiphase flow and geomechanics.[Test 1] Scaled vs. Non-Scaled models:For comparison withCase-Ref (Scaled) first, we take two different models: scaled capillarypressure with non-scaled permeability (Pc-Scaled) and a completelyscale-free (Non-Scaled) models. For Pc-Scaled, the scaling factor (𝜉) isapplied only to 𝑃𝑐, with 𝜉= 1 (implying no scaling factor) used forthe permeability. Other parameters from the van Genuchten capillarypressure and relative permeability models remain consistent across allthree models.Fig. 3 demonstrates remarkable differences between Case-Ref(Scaled) and Non-Scaled models near the wellbore after one day of heatinjection. Case-Ref exhibits generally higher values of gas pressure (𝑝𝐺),temperature (𝑇), gas saturation (𝑆𝐺), and hydrate saturation (𝑆𝐻). Thegas pressure in Case-Ref is notably higher and more localized, with asteeper gradient near the wellbore. Its temperature is also marginallyhigher compared to the Non-Scaled model. Furthermore, the secondaryhydrate formation is observed in Case-Ref, as indicated in Fig. 3(d).Fig. 4 presents the evolution of pressure (𝑝𝐺and 𝑃𝑐) and saturation(𝑆𝐺and 𝑆𝐻) at OBS for Case-Ref, Pc-only, and Non-Scaled models.Note that Case-Ref exhibits significantly higher initial capillary pressurecompared to the other cases, despite identical initial saturations. Thisis attributed to the scaling factor (𝜉), which accounts for changes inhydrate saturation and pore-size. Meanwhile, capillary pressure of Pc-Scaled is not markedly different from that of Non-Scaled. An increasein 𝑆𝐻(i.e., secondary hydrate formation) is observed in Case-Ref,resulting from rapid rise in 𝑝𝐺and 𝑝𝐴during the simulation. Thisresult is accentuated by the no-flow boundary condition near the well-bore in this example, shifting the equilibrium state, i.e., from hydratedissociation to formation. An increase in 𝑆𝐻then leads to reduced pore-size, raising capillary pressure locally. Concurrently, this secondaryhydrate formation reduces 𝑆𝐺, which can lower capillary pressure.As of result of these competing factors, capillary pressure in Case-Refexhibits non-monotonic behavior, unlike the other two cases.In all three cases, any porosity changes induced by geomechan-ical deformation are also taken into account for the capillary pres-sure. Particularly, for Case-Ref, these effects are amplified through thescaling factor. Fig. 5 compares geomechanical deformations throughvolumetric strain (𝜖𝑣) between Non-Scaled (left) and Case-Ref (right).Interestingly, Non-Scaled shows slight compaction near the wellbore,whereas Case-Ref results in more pronounced dilation at the samelocation, a consequence of heightened pressure levels depicted in Fig. 4.[Test 2] Different model parameters:We further explore caseswith varied model parameters and variables relative to Case-Ref. Specif-ically, three cases are tested with different 𝜆, 𝑃𝑒𝑛, and 𝑆𝑖𝑟𝐺valuesthan Case-Ref, while keeping all other parameters constant. We adopt𝜆= 0.7, 𝑃𝑒𝑛= 4.0 MPa, and 𝑆𝑖𝑟𝐺= 0.49 × 10−5 for three capillarypressure curves.

For-mation of secondary hydrate, indicated by an increase in 𝑆𝐻, leadsto a concurrent decrease in 𝑆𝐺. Subsequently, 𝑆𝐺rises again due togas influx. We note more pronounced non-monotonicity in case with𝑃𝑒𝑛= 4.0 MPa, which represents stronger capillarity. Meanwhile, adistinctive response is observed in the case with 𝑆𝑖𝑟𝐺= 0.49 × 10−5,differing from other cases including Case-Ref. This is because the gasrelative permeability model is determined from Eq. (31), as opposed toothers that follow Eq. (30). A continuous increase in 𝑆𝐻coupled witha drop in 𝑆𝐺below 0.002 results in low gas relative permeability andcorrespondingly small effective permeability, leading to a distinct trendin Pc unlike the other cases.[Test 3] Impact of initial gas saturation: To examine the influenceof initial non-wetting phase saturation, we take three different caseswith varying initial gas saturations: 𝑆𝐺,0 = 0.001, 𝑆𝐺,0 = 0.01 (Case-Ref), and 𝑆𝐺,0 = 0.1. This also relates to the film thickness in theinterfacial length scales,38,39 and can impact the relative permeabilityof the gaseous phase.Fig. 6(b) demonstrates that the case with 𝑆𝐺,0 = 0.1 exhibits thehighest capillary pressure, attributed to the largest initial non-wettingphase saturation. Note that 𝑃𝑐starts to decline at around 0.6 dayas 𝑆𝐻decreases while 𝑆𝐺also diminishes, leading to a generallymonotonic behavior for capillary pressure. Meanwhile, in the case with𝑆𝐺,0 = 0.001, we note a pronounced hump with rapid secondary hydrateformation. This results in amplified non-monotonic trends in 𝑃𝑐, drivenby the small initial non-wetting phase saturation with higher gradientsin gas saturation change ((𝐵to 𝐵′) or (𝐵′ to 𝐵) in Fig. 1), as well asthe enhanced pore-size effect ((𝐴to 𝐴′) or (𝐴′ to 𝐴) in Fig. 1) with thehighest 𝑆𝐻.[Test 4] Different relative permeability models: Given the criticalrole of relative permeability in influencing the scaled capillary pressureand gas flow, we consider two alternative relative permeability modelsadding to Case-Ref: Corey’s model40 and the modified Stone’s model.41```"

For the modified Stone’s model, both𝑛𝐴and 𝑛𝐺are set to be 1.5.In Fig. 6(c), the relatively moderate results from Corey’s modelindicate that the relative permeabilities of aqueous and gaseous phases(per Eq. (32) and (33)) are smaller compared to other models. Initially,before 0.2 day, Corey’s model exhibits a slight non-monotonic changein 𝑃𝑐and 𝑆𝐺(𝐵to 𝐵′ in Fig. 1). Subsequently, there is a gradualdecline in 𝑆𝐺accompanied by a monotonic increase in 𝑆𝐻, leading toanother minor non-monotonic rise in 𝑃𝑐(𝐴′ to 𝐴in Fig. 1) after 0.8day.

The scaled effect is predicatedon sediment pore-size variations resulting from hydrate dissociation or formation, leading to non-monotoniccapillary pressure curves influenced by two primary factors: alterations in pore space and gas saturation.Specifically, hydrate dissociation may increase pore space, thereby reducing capillary pressure. Conversely,enhanced gas saturation owing to dissociation can elevate capillary pressure. We employ a scaled capillarypressure model, accounting for porosity fluctuations caused by hydrate formation or dissociation. Additionally,equivalent pore pressure is utilized to ensure the numerical stability and accuracy in scenarios of strongcapillarity. The numerical experiments incorporate two distinct methodologies for hydrate dissociation: heatinjection and depressurization. In the heat injection scenario, sensitivity analyses are conducted using a rangeof model parameters, exhibiting characteristic non-monotonic capillary pressure behaviors attributable to theaforementioned competing factors. Regarding the depressurization approach, the UBGH2-6 site in the UlleungBasin, East Sea, South Korea, is selected as a real-world field case. Over a 30-day gas production simulation,we observe notable enhancements in hydrate dissociation, signifying improved productivity, and distinctivegeomechanical responses, under the influence of the scaled model. This investigation demonstrates that thescaled capillary pressure model, upon the hydrate or ice (i.e., solid) phase change, with coupled flow andgeomechanics is crucial for accurate modeling of gas hydrate deposits.1. IntroductionGas hydrates necessitate cutting-edge technology and strategy fortheir sustainable production, as they are typically located in extremeenvironments characterized by high pressure and low temperature,such as deep oceanic sediments or permafrost regions. Complex mul-tiphysical processes are also involved in their dissociation upon thethermodynamic properties.1–3 One of such phenomena is capillary pres-sure, and it has been an important topic in many applied engineeringfields related to the multiphase flow in porous media.4–9 Depending onwettability of porous media, capillary pressure can be modeled usingvarious functions of wetting-phase saturation and parameters.Ther-modynamically, it can also be approached through interfacial energy.10Along with experimentally and physically reliable relative permeabil-ity models,11–13 capillary pressure has recently been a focal point ofintense study in gas hydrate reservoir research.Capillarity is particularly critical for gas hydrates because pore(throat) size significantly impacts capillary pressure,14 and hydrate∗Corresponding author.E-mail address: hyun.yoon@kigam.re.kr (H.C. Yoon).dissociation results in an increase in pore-size.For instance, the ex-pansion of pore space due to hydrate dissociation can cause a decreasein the capillary pressure. Numerous studies have been conducted to ex-plore the relationship between capillary pressure and pore-size changesresulting from hydrate phase depositions.15–19 A recent study19 exper-imentally confirmed this scaled effect, observing that higher hydratesaturation elevates the water retention curve. However, this study didnot consider dynamics between hydrate and gas saturations duringactive hydrate dissociation/formation processes. Concurrent with theexpansion of pore-size during hydrate dissociation, an increase in gassaturation can also lead to a rise in capillary pressure. Therefore, thetwo primary competing factors influencing the capillary pressure of gashydrates are changes in pore-size and gas saturation, potentially leadingto a non-monotonic evolution of capillarity.Moreover, coupled effects of geomechanical deformation withscaled capillary pressure are yet to study.

This framework would also aid in the analysis of futurehazards associated with climate change effects on precipitation recurrence intervals similar to Kim et al. (2023).Wildfires occur across a range of ecoregions and climates. However, relatively few studies have explored or charac-terized how post-wildfire hydrologic effects may vary across space. Recent work has quantified the meteorologicaldrivers of post-wildfire debris flows in southern California (Oakley et al., 2017), and we advocate for developing a simi-lar framework for understanding the hydrometeorological drivers of other post-wildfire hydrologic effects, includinghow they may vary in space and time. Such a framework could help guide both model development and data collectionthrough characterizing the critical events and processes that QPE data need to capture and to which models need to besensitive. Combining the results from such a framework with climate projections would provide valuable informationabout how both the drivers of post-wildfire hydrology and associated hazards may change under various futurescenarios.5|CONCLUSIONWildfires can modify the partitioning of precipitation into streamflow and other hydrologic fluxes across the landscape,leading to immediate and prolonged effects on communities and ecosystems. Understanding and simulating the hydro-logic response to wildfire, including the societally relevant effects, such as debris flows and water-quality degradation,requires an appropriate depiction of physical processes (either explicitly or implicitly) for the modeling objectives aswell as sufficient representation of precipitation events. Model-forcing precipitation data products can vary widely inresolution, accuracy, and completeness, potentially leading to different modeling results and interpretations. Whenselecting a forcing dataset for a particular post-wildfire modeling objective, exploring and discussing known limitationsand uncertainties in forcing data will improve users' interpretations of model results.Several opportunities may advance post-wildfire hydrologic model applications through focusing on model-forcingdata:1. Expandingprecipitationgagenetworksthroughacademicandgovernmentalorganizationsaswellascitizen-supported science is critical for improving precipitation datasets. Given the costs and challenges of installingprecipitation gages, efforts focusing on areas within critical watersheds that are prone to wildfire and other land usedisturbances may be most advantageous. Post-wildfire precipitation gage network optimization studies could helpreduce installation costs.2. Understanding the precipitation drivers of post-wildfire hydrologic effects, including how they vary in space andtime, could inform future modeling studies as well as highlight data gaps in model forcing data.3. Further comparisons and evaluations of high-resolution QPE data, especially for critical events over short timescales, would help highlight the strengths and limitations of different datasets.4. A detailed diagnostic evaluation of model sensitivity, including the relative sources of uncertainty (i.e., forcing datavs. parameters vs. structural) could highlight areas to focus on for improving post-wildfire hydrologic modeling.Most post-wildfire modeling studies rely on established hydrologic models. Model performance and sources ofuncertainty are fairly well documented in model applications of undisturbed systems, but few studies have focusedon model uncertainty in a post-wildfire setting.5. Future studies could explore the distributed response to wildfire across the landscape, including connections toprecipitation-forcing data. Most post-wildfire hydrologic studies attempt to capture the hydrologic response at dis-crete points within the modeling domain (e.g., established stream gages), potentially obscuring compensatory pro-cesses that vary in space. While simulating and evaluating model performance over distributed variables (bothabove and below the ground surface) is of course limited by observational data, this may be enhanced by more fre-quent sampling or wider distribution of sampling sites.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSTrevor F.

In locations whereother observations may be sparse or unreliable, satellite QPE can be an appealing option for forcing hydrologic models(Le et al., 2020). The relatively coarse spatial resolution (most satellite products have a horizontal resolution >10 km;Figure 2) could limit the utility of satellite QPE products for many post-wildfire model applications, and relatively fewstudies have incorporated satellite QPE into post-wildfire model applications (Ebel et al., 2023). Still, some data sets,such as NASA's Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global precipitation measurement (IMERG; Huffmanet al., 2020) have sub-hourly data—IMERG has global 30-min precipitation estimates (Figure 3), which could be usefulfor predicting post-wildfire flooding and debris flows (e.g., Orland et al., 2022) if high spatial resolution data are notavailable. Furthermore, downscaled and blended satellite QPE products such as the Climate Hazards Group InfraRedPrecipitation with Station (CHIRPS; Funk et al., 2015) datasets or a daily 1 km global surface precipitation dataset pres-ented in Karger et al. (2021) could be viable options for forcing post-wildfire hydrologic models.Considerations for utilizing satellite QPE data in post-wildfire model applications include:1. Coarse spatial resolutions could limit direct forcing of post-wildfire hydrologic models in some applications. Blended anddownscaled products could be useful for model applications that do not require high temporal resolution data (Table 1).2. The accuracy of satellite-derived precipitation timing, amount, and intensity likely varies with seasonality and lati-tude (Ebert et al., 2007), and biases could relate to orography (Derin & Yilmaz, 2014), elevation (Stampoulis &Anagnostou, 2012), and season (Thiemig et al., 2012). Many satellite QPE products tend to overestimate dry seasonprecipitation and underestimate wet season precipitation over global mountain ranges, and the quality of gage-corrected data is dependent on the reference gage-network (Derin et al., 2016).3. Satellite-derived QPE are most useful over regions with limited gage networks. However, satellite-derived QPE prod-ucts likely need to be bias-adjusted using ground-based observations before being used as forcing data for a hydro-logic model. Even a small number of gages may provide improved model performance over models forced solelywith uncorrected satellite QPE data (Stephens et al., 2022).3.4|Gridded observational dataEven assuming that each of the roughly 100,000 official rain gages is independent of one another and reasonably repre-sents a 5-km radius, <1% of the Earth's surface area is covered by a precipitation gage (Kidd et al., 2017). Gridded obser-vational datasets attempt to interpolate precipitation rates between precipitation gages via geographic variables such asslope, elevation, and latitude. Some datasets may incorporate precipitation estimates from satellites and ground-basedradar (e.g., MRMS gage corrected data; Zhang et al., 2016) or be a purely station interpolated product (e.g., Daymet;Thornton et al., 2022). There are important differences in the final precipitation spatial fields associated with theselected interpolation method, potentially leading to errors that can propagate through to model output (Hwanget al., 2012). Still, like radar-derived QPE, gridded observations are not commonly used in post-wildfire hydrologicmodel applications (Ebel et al., 2023), even though there is some evidence that gridded climate products could be a via-ble alternative to in-situ observations over small unburned catchments in Sweden (Ledesma & Futter, 2017) and largerbasins across the CONUS (Essou et al., 2016).Challenges for utilizing gridded observational data in post-wildfire model applications include:1. Daily data may not be useful for predicting post-wildfire hazards such as debris flows and flash floods.2. Regridding and interpolating from the native resolution to the hydrologic model grid will introduce additional error.This source of error could be critical when calibrating and evaluating model performance.3. Spatially interpolating between stations can smooth precipitation patterns, especially when zero and nonzero valuesare in close proximity. This can lead to a dampening of extreme events (Daly et al., 2021).4. There is significant variability in precipitation estimates between products due to methodological and data assimila-tion approaches used, especially over complex mountainous terrain. For example, Figure 3 illustrates substantial dif-ferences in total accumulated and areal mean precipitation for a single storm over the Grizzly Creek burned area.Daymet, which does not assimilate radar data, shows a substantially different spatial pattern and double the daily12 of 27PARTRIDGE ET AL. 20491948, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wat2.1728, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

Gage-corrected data, such as the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) stage IV QPEs (Lin & Mitchell, 2005)and the MultiRadar MultiSensor (MRMS; Zhang et al., 2016) system, both produced at the National Centers forEnvironmental Prediction (NCEP) have latencies of several hours, which could potentially limit their utility in appli-cations that require real-time QPE such as hazard forecasting. Gage correction algorithms may also incorrectly dis-card gage observations if the algorithm uses radar as quality control. For example, if the radar data indicate zeroprecipitation, potentially due to sensing above the storm, gage observations correctly measuring precipitation maynot be included in the correction, leading to significant underestimation in the QPE dataset (Bytheway et al., 2019).5. Mobile ground-based systems provide QPE at a very high resolution (Porcacchia et al., 2017), however they areexpensive to deploy and may require extensive calibration including deriving local rainfall reflectivity relationships.FIGURE 3Comparison of sampled gridded precipitation products for a convective storm on June 26–27, 2021, over the Grizzly Creekburned area in western Colorado that resulted in several destructive debris flows in Glenwood Canyon that led to the closure of an interstatehighway.

Precipitation is used as primary input to hydrologic models and is a crit-ical driver of post-wildfire hydrologic hazards including debris flows, flashfloods, water-quality effects, and reservoir sedimentation. These models arevaluable tools for understanding the hydrologic response to wildfire butrequire accurate precipitation data at suitable spatial and temporal resolutions.Wildfires often occur in data-sparse, headwater catchments in complex terrain,and post-wildfire hydrologic effects are particularly sensitive to high-intensity,short-duration precipitation events, which are highly variable and difficult tomeasure or estimate. Therefore, the assessment and prediction of wildfire-induced changes to watershed hydrology, including the associated effects onecosystems and communities, are complicated by uncertainty in precipitationdata. When direct measurements of precipitation are not available, datasets ofindirect measurements or estimates are often used. Choosing the most appro-priate precipitation dataset can be difficult as different datasets have uniquetrade-offs in terms of spatial and temporal accuracy, resolution, and complete-ness. Here, we outline the challenges and opportunities associated with differ-ent precipitation datasets as they apply to post-wildfire hydrologic models andmodeling objectives.

WIREs Water - 2024 - Partridge - Opportunities and challenges for precipitation forcing data in post‐wildfire hydrologic.pdf,"media/WIREs Water - 2024 - Partridge - Opportunities and challenges for precipitation forcing data in post‐wildfire hydrologic.pdf:```Challenges for utilizing ground-based radar QPE in post-wildfire model applications include:1. Errors associated with terrain shadowing and beam broadening are most apparent in regions with high topographicrelief (Cao et al., 2014; Kirstetter et al., 2015), typical of many wildfires. Relatively few studies have evaluatedhigh-resolution radar-derived QPE data for short-duration, high-intensity rainfall. There is high uncertainty inradar-derived QPE datasets as well as other QPE datasets in the western CONUS (e.g., Bytheway et al., 2019;Bytheway et al., 2020).2. The relationship between radar-measured reflectivity (Z) and actual rain rate (R) is typically expressed by theMarshall–Palmer relationship (Marshall & Palmer, 1948) by fitting a deterministic exponential function Z ¼ aRbto simultaneous observations of Z at altitude and R at ground level. This relationship is acknowledged to be non-linear and vary with time and altitude, leading to uncertainty in radar-based QPE (Adirosi et al., 2016; Neuper &Ehret, 2019).3. Spatial coverage challenges may limit the use of radar data in some post-wildfire modeling studies. Over CONUS,radar coverage is significantly more limited in the western US (Zhang et al., 2016), which has historically been thefocus of most post-fire hydrologic modeling initiatives.TABLE 2(Continued)Idealized storms and weather generatorsTraining data dependentSub-daily to dailyNot applicableTraining dependent• Efficient way to generate statistically consistent ensembles ofweather data• Sensitive to inaccuracies in the observational dataset and canstruggle to accurately capture extreme events• Offer an alternative where long term climate records are onlypartially available or missing• Sub-daily versions exist, but most stochastic weather generatorsoperate at a daily time stepaWeather radar base data (reflectivity, radial velocity, spectrum width) are available dating back to 1991 from NEXRAD stations (NOAA, 1991).FIGURE 2Typical temporal and spatial resolutions of QPE datasets (colored rectangles) with corresponding scales of post-wildfirehydrologic modeling objectives (blue dashed boxes) and select meteorological events (Orlanski, 1975; black dashed ovals).

Studies evaluating the perfor-mance of hydrologic models in unburned basins forced with different types of meteorological forcing data have foundencouraging results from simulations driven with climate reanalysis (Chen & Brissette, 2017), but their historically coarsespatial resolution (Figures 2 and 3) could limit the utility of climate reanalysis QPE data in post-wildfire model applica-tions. Newer high-resolution reanalysis products, such as the CONUS404 dataset (Rasmussen et al., 2023), could be well-suited for post-wildfire studies, but it may be necessary to bias-correct reanalysis data before using to force a hydrologicmodel, especially if the hydrologic model is using a sub-daily timestep (Sivasubramaniam et al., 2020). CONUS404 is a40-plus-year (October 1979 to September 2021), 4-km retrospective dataset that dynamically downscales ERA5 data usingthe Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF; Skamarock et al., 2008) with precipitation output every 15-min.1. Underlying biases from the Earth system models used to generate climate reanalysis data may propagate through tofinal data products. For example, many Earth system models do not account for acute landscape disturbances, suchas wildfire, which can alter land-atmosphere interactions, affecting many meteorological variables.2. Like other gridded data, reanalysis products will likely require pre-processing to be used as model forcing. This canintroduce additional error into the forcing dataset which should be accounted for when evaluating model output.3. Reanalysis data will likely contain biases that may need to be corrected before the data can be used to force a hydro-logic model, especially for applications sensitive to short-duration high-intensity rainfall. For example, NLDAS dis-aggregates daily estimates of precipitation using hourly weights from radar-based QPE (Cosgrove et al., 2003).CONUS404 captures the timing of June 2021 precipitation over Glenwood Canyon, Colorado after the 2021 GrizzlyCreek fire reasonably well, but appears to overestimate precipitation totals (Figure 3).3.6|Numerical weather prediction and climate model projectionsWhile the scale and purpose of Numerical Weather Models (NWMs) and climate models are different, we discuss themjointly here as they both provide some estimate of future precipitation. NWMs assimilate current weather observationsto make short-term forecasts (hours to weeks) of future weather patterns. These models can provide high-resolutionprecipitation estimates that could be used for post-wildfire debris-flow hazard forecasting (Oakley et al., 2023). Climatemodels provide longer term projections (tens to hundreds of years) of how climate patterns could change as a result ofdiffering socioeconomic and emissions trajectories. Climate model data may be too coarse to directly force hydrologicmodels at scales relevant to wildfire effects, however, they provide a benchmark for exploring how thehydrologic response to wildfire, and the associated hazards, may change under future conditions.1. Deterministic NWM simulations (both historical runs and forecasts) provide a specific prediction of atmosphericconditions based on the best available information (i.e., initial conditions, physical parameters, and model struc-ture). Single-model simulations do not account for uncertainty and will most likely have biases that may need to beaddressed when using the data to force a hydrologic model.2. Future climate projections from global climate models will need to be statistically or dynamically downscaled beforethey can be used to force hydrologic models investigating hydrologic response to wildfire. There are a variety ofdownscaling approaches each with their own strengths and weaknesses for consideration.3.7|Idealized storms and weather generatorsIdealized storms are the second most commonly used forcing data source in current post-wildfire hydrologic modelapplications (Ebel et al., 2023). The specific data structure can vary depending on study design.

Short-term weather forecasts can then provide probabilistic estimates of post-wildfire hazards(Oakley et al., 2023). Interstorm timescales (i.e., weeks to months) become important for modeling longer-term or largerscale wildfire effects on hydrologic processes, such as streamflow response or effects on water quality (Hernandezet al., 2018; Springer et al., 2015). These modeling applications are more likely to utilize rainfall data with longer accu-mulation times (Moody & Martin, 2001a; Soulis et al., 2012) such as daily precipitation from gridded datasets. Mecha-nistic studies, or those focused on understanding processes, are likely the broadest of the four listed categories. Thesestudies tend to focus on the wildfire effects on a particular hydrologic component (e.g., baseflow; Bart & Tague, 2017), aspecific storm (e.g., Ebel et al., 2016), or the variability of the hydrologic response (e.g., Rakhmatulina et al., 2021). Theforcing data requirements for these studies will vary depending on the selected model's timestep, spatial resolution, andprocess representation.2.2|Model classes in post-wildfire hydrologic assessmentsWe follow Partington et al. (2022) and categorize post-wildfire hydrologic models as Data-driven, Conceptual, or Physi-cally based (Mount et al., 2016; Partington et al., 2022). Data-driven models abstract physical processes(e.g., evapotranspiration, infiltration, baseflow, etc.) using empirical, statistical, or machine learning techniques to pre-dict some aspect of system behavior (e.g., soil moisture) from available data. Data-driven models (e.g., Foltz et al., 2009;Moody, 2012) are computationally efficient and quick to deploy, and can provide valuable insight into the net hydro-logic response to wildfire (e.g., Williams et al., 2022). However, they provide relatively limited mechanistic understand-ing, and the empirically derived relationships may become inaccurate under novel environmental or meteorologicalconditions. Conceptual models represent some larger-scale physical processes with simplified equations based onestablished relationships. Model parameters may not reflect real-world conditions as they are typically calibrated, notmeasured directly. Physically based models attempt to deterministically represent the vertical and horizontal fluxes ofmoisture and energy between the atmosphere, surface, and sub-surface typically at a much smaller scale than data-driven or conceptual models.A model's spatial discretization can be important for representing landscape heterogeneity, such as burn severity,and capturing the spatial variability of precipitation. In semi-distributed, or lumped, models, all areas with similardefining features (e.g., land cover, soil type, and elevation) are combined into Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs). Thisaggregation could obscure important spatial variation provided by high-resolution precipitation forcing data (Priceet al., 2014). Fully distributed (e.g., gridded) physically based models offer the most explicit representation of hydrologicBOX 2Snowfall and snowpack dataSeasonal snow is a crucial water resource in the western US, and there is a significant overlap betweenwildfire-prone areas and the seasonal snow zone (Gleason et al., 2019). Wildfire can have large effects on snow-pack dynamics due to changes in canopy interception, shading, and snow albedo (Kampf et al., 2022), andincorporating these processes into hydrologic models is critical for understanding and predicting wildfire effectson water resources (Penn et al., 2020). Although not model forcing data, accurate estimates of snow depth andsnow water equivalent are important for calibrating and evaluating hydrologic models. Most physical modelsinternally partition precipitation between liquid and solid phases based on relatively simple temperaturethresholds (e.g., Jordan, 1991), making accurate air temperature data critical for capturing rain-snow transitionsin distributed models. Temperature can often be reasonably estimated from a relatively sparse station network(Attorre et al., 2007) but tipping bucket precipitation gages are prone to undercatch and “plugging” (the collec-tion of snow inside the gage) during snowfall (Heggli et al., 2022; Wolff et al., 2015). Compared with weight-based precipitation gages, heated tipping buckets may report up to 25% less precipitation and exhibit roughlya 30-min delay in recording the onset of snowfall (Savina et al., 2012). Snowpack monitoring networks such asthe SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) network operated by the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service pro-vide high-quality estimates of current snowpack conditions; however, it is difficult to interpolate between sta-tions, and regional estimates of snowpack properties are difficult or costly to observe directly.6 of 27PARTRIDGE ET AL. 20491948, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wat2.1728, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

Elevated hydrologic hazards are concen-trated in the first 2–3 years following wildfire (e.g., Kunze & Stednick, 2006) but can persist for a decade or longer asvegetation regrows and soil hydraulic properties return to pre-wildfire conditions (Ffolliott et al., 1996; Niemeyeret al., 2020). Wildfire-induced vegetation mortality and changes in near-surface soil properties can lead to temporarilyincreased rates of surface runoff through decreased rates of canopy interception (e.g., Stoof et al., 2012), transpiration(Collar et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2020), and infiltration (e.g., Ebel, 2019). From a water resources perspective, both thequality and quantity of water can be impacted by wildfire. Increased rates of sedimentation (e.g., East et al., 2021;Wagenbrenner & Robichaud, 2014) and the mobilization of contaminants (e.g., Murphy et al., 2015; Murphyet al., 2018; Nunes et al., 2018; Paul et al., 2022) are frequent problems for water providers. Wildfire activity(Abatzoglou & Williams, 2016) and extreme precipitation intensities (Fowler et al., 2021; Prein et al., 2017) are projectedto increase as a result of anthropogenic climate change, likely resulting in elevated post-wildfire hydrologic hazards(Oakley, 2021; Touma et al., 2022). Improving our predictive capacity through increased monitoring, process under-standing, and the continued integration of post-wildfire hydrology into hydrologic and hazard forecast models will becritical for providing accurate guidance to emergency and water resource managers on the timing, extent, and severityof post-wildfire hydrologic hazards and water availability concerns. Accurate precipitation data at sufficiently high reso-lution are crucial for forcing hydrologic models. Selecting the most appropriate dataset for a specific modeling applica-tion can be complicated due to the wide variety of available precipitation-forcing data. This can be especially true in apost-wildfire modeling application due to the scale and setting of the hydrologic response to wildfire.Post-wildfire hydrologic effects defined here as impaired water quality, reservoir sedimentation, flash floods, hyper-concentrated flows, and debris flows occur at different spatiotemporal scales, but are all strongly controlled by thetiming, duration, and intensity of precipitation events following wildfire. For example, the initiation of a post-wildfiredebris flow will require an exceedance of a critical rainfall rate, referred to as a rainfall intensity-duration threshold(Staley et al., 2013). Short-duration rainfall intensity-duration thresholds (i.e., 15-min) are better predictors of post-wildfire debris flow hazards than longer duration metrics (Kean et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2022; Moody & Martin, 2001b;Thomas et al., 2023), possibly due to the importance of rapid infiltration-excess runoff generation. The threshold fordebris-flow initiation varies with pre-wildfire vegetation structure, burn severity, topography, geology, and soils (Staleyet al., 2017), and likely increases with time since fire (e.g., Cannon et al., 2011; Hoch et al., 2021). Post-wildfire flashfloods and water availability effects tend to occur at larger spatial scales than debris flows; at this larger scale, burnseverity, precipitation, and landscape factors are more spatially heterogeneous, introducing additional challenges inmeasuring, assessing, and predicting post-wildfire hydrologic hazards (e.g., Liu et al., 2022). Modeling efforts focusedon smaller scale effects such as debris flows require precipitation data at a high temporal resolution and typically relyon rain gages close to the catchment of interest. Because precipitation is a first-order control on post-wildfire hydrologichazards and water-quality effects (Box 1), accurate precipitation data are a precursor to understanding and predictinglocal and regional hydrologic responses following wildfire.Quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) often have significant uncertainty (Bytheway et al., 2020; Clark &Slater, 2006), potentially leading to differences between datasets. For example, estimates of total annual precipitationcan vary by as much as 300 mm across global products (Q. Sun, Miao, et al., 2018), with important implications for2 of 27PARTRIDGE ET AL. 20491948, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wat2.1728, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

Long-term, homogenous data records from precipitation gages make them ideal for generatingIDF curves. However, sparse gage networks common in some regions prone to wildfire can make it challenging to pro-duce station-based IDF curves. Several studies have utilized radar QPE to overcome the challenges of gage-based IDFcurves (e.g., Ghebreyesus & Sharif, 2021; Marra & Morin, 2015; McGraw et al., 2019; Overeem et al., 2009); however,several opportunities remain.

The range of temporal and spatial resolutions for each cate-gory is illustrated in Figure 2. Below, we discuss each data type and enumerate their key challenges as they pertain topost-wildfire hydrologic modeling applications. We then discuss the strengths and limitations of existing QPE productsfrom differing data sources and provide considerations for selecting QPE forcing data.3.1|Station-based observationsStation-based observations provide the only direct observation of precipitation making landfall on Earth's surface, andare the most accurate representation of precipitation events near the gage (Price et al., 2014). Most post-wildfire hydro-logic modeling applications to date have relied exclusively on measurements at precipitation gages (Ebel et al., 2023),but many burned catchments lack existing precipitation gages. High-frequency (i.e., sub-daily) pre- and post-wildfireprecipitation estimates from within the burn perimeter remain a major gap in understanding the hydrologic responseto wildfire and predicting post-wildfire water-quality issues (Murphy et al., 2023).Challenges for utilizing station-based precipitation gage data include:1. Precipitation gages fail to capture the spatial variability of precipitation events, especially over complex terrainand/or during periods of high-intensity rainfall (Vasiloff et al., 2009). Watershed total precipitation can be poorlyrepresented by extrapolating data from point gages (Starks & Moriasi, 2009; Tobin & Bennett, 2009), making itimportant to consider the location of the gage within the watershed (Michelon et al., 2021) and not assume spatiallyuniform precipitation rates (Goodrich et al., 1995).2. Spurious data can arise from wind effects, instrument damage, and operational errors. The tipping-buckets used bymany rain gages have been shown to have persistent negative biases, especially during high-intensity events, due towind-associated undercatch and mechanical malfunctions (Ciach, 2003; Groisman & Legates, 1994; Moliniet al., 2005). See McMillan et al. (2012) for a comprehensive review of uncertainty in precipitation data. Data qualitycontrol and homogenization are often important to correct for these errors (McMillan et al., 2018; Menne &Williams, 2009), but can be challenging at shorter time steps (e.g., Heggli et al., 2022; Oakley et al., 2018).3. Many wildfire-prone basins have sparse precipitation gage networks. The installation of precipitation gages follow-ing a wildfire can provide critical information for correcting bias in interpolated and remotely sensed QPE productsand forcing post-wildfire hydrologic models. However, the lack of a long-term record could complicate contextualiz-ing post-wildfire precipitation events.3.2|Ground radar derived QPEGround-based radar provides high spatial resolution QPE through measuring the reflectivity of hydrometeors. Uncer-tainty in ground-based radar QPE can arise from the relationship selected between reflectivity and rain rate(Atlas, 2015) and differences in the location of observed hydrometeors and where the precipitation makes landfall—which might be kilometers downwind if it reaches the ground at all. Ground-based radar QPE is in theory superior toareal mean estimates from precipitation gages due to the improved spatial variability (Figure 3), and hydrologic modelsdriven with radar QPE often show improved performance (e.g., He et al., 2013), especially in predicting peak flows andin areas with a low gage density (Sidman et al., 2016). However, radar QPE remains relatively underutilized in post-wildfire hydrologic model applications (Ebel et al., 2023). Many watershed scale hydrologic models are not able to bedirectly run with gridded input data, which could limit the adoption of radar-based forcing data (and other gridded pre-cipitation data) into watershed scale models (Price et al., 2014). Fully distributed models such as WEPP (Laflenet al., 1997), HEC-HMS (Bartles et al., 2022), WRF-Hydro (Gochis et al., 2020), and KINEROS2 (Goodrich et al., 2012)which often require gridded input data and operate on a shorter timestep, are well suited for radar QPEs. The high spa-tiotemporal resolution of radar QPE could improve model performance (e.g., Li et al., 2022); however, users should beaware that post-wildfire hazards are sensitive to rainfall rates (e.g., Moody, 2012; Thomas et al., 2023), and biases inQPE can lead to model performance that may be unacceptable for certain applications (e.g., Yatheendradaset al., 2008).8 of 27PARTRIDGE ET AL. 20491948, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wat2.1728, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

However, finer-resolution simulations can result in higher computationalcosts and longer runtimes. See Partington et al. (2022) for an overview of post-wildfire runoff modeling approaches.Meta-analyses on post-wildfire erosion modeling and physically based hydrologic modeling are provided by Lopes et al.(2021) and Ebel et al. (2023), respectively. An overview of the challenges associated with predicting post-wildfire debrisflow hazards is provided by Hyde et al. (2016).2.3|Model requirements and source of model uncertaintyModel input data, parameterization, and computational processing requirements increase with model complexity. Data-driven models can approximate system behavior (e.g., streamflow) using precipitation data from relatively few weather sta-tions within a catchment. However, fully distributed physical models will typically require spatially distributed hydrome-teorological datasets as well as information about the domain's land cover, including detailed information on burnseverity, and geology (Partington et al., 2022). These models often require several meteorological variables such as temper-ature, precipitation rate, radiation, and wind velocity at a sub-daily timestep to resolve energy budgets. All modelingefforts are subject to multiple sources of uncertainty arising from structural biases in the modeling framework, the param-eterization of processes and/or variables that are unknown or cannot be resolved explicitly, and inherent biases in themodel forcing dataset, boundary conditions, and initialization (Beven & Freer, 2001; Renard et al., 2010). In post-wildfirehydrologic model applications, there is little consensus on how to modify vegetation, soil, and channel parameters, includ-ing how they recover over time (Ebel et al., 2023), and many of these effects may occur at spatial scales poorly representedby current models in unburned environments (Clark et al., 2017). Modelers often must make assumptions or rely onexpert knowledge over direct observations when adjusting these model parameters to approximate post-wildfire condi-tions (Ebel et al., 2023) unless post-wildfire data are available for calibration (e.g., Lew et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022).There have been considerable efforts to understand, quantify, and reduce uncertainty in hydrologic models throughvarious uncertainty analysis techniques and data assimilation approaches (e.g., Liu & Gupta, 2007; Moges et al., 2021).In typical rainfall-runoff model applications, forcing data uncertainties, which can be as high as 40% for precipitation(McMillan et al., 2018), can lead to high levels of predictive uncertainty in model response (Yatheendradas et al., 2008),as well as biases in parameter estimation (Duan et al., 2003) and erroneous water balance calculations (Engelandet al., 2016). These uncertainties can be especially pronounced in data-sparse regions (Bardossy et al., 2020; Murphyet al., 2017). While air temperature, in theory, is more spatially uniform than precipitation, uncertainties in both tem-perature and precipitation forcing data can lead to similar ranges of error in simulated water budgets over snow-dominated mountainous basins as a result of snowpack temperature sensitivity (Schreiner-McGraw & Ajami, 2022).Furthermore, most gridded products will need to be regridded to match the model's resolution. Regridding will alterprecipitation estimates, especially at high quantiles, and over finer spatial resolutions and shorter timesteps (Rajulapatiet al., 2021), yet uncertainty introduced with model pre-processing is rarely explored when discussing model results.The sources and relative contributions of uncertainty will likely be different in a post-wildfire setting due to changes inthe vegetation and hydraulic parameters and outsized influence of localized, high-intensity rainfall. In the context ofpost-wildfire conditions, several studies have explored model parameter uncertainty (e.g., Breuer et al., 2009; Langhanset al., 2016; Mahat et al., 2015; Seibert et al., 2010) and model sensitivity to forcing data through incorporating climatechange scenarios (e.g., Rakhmatulina et al., 2021). However, to the best of our knowledge, there has not been a thor-ough evaluation of uncertainty sources (i.e., the relative contributions of uncertainty arising from model structure,model parameters, and model forcing data) in a post-wildfire setting. Such a comparison could help guide future effortson identifying, quantifying, and reducing post-wildfire hydrologic model uncertainty and potentially inform theadvancement of model forcing datasets.3|GAPS AND CHALLENGES IN CURRENT PRECIPITATIONFORCING DATAThe most common types of hydrologic model precipitation forcing data can be divided into several categories:(i) station-based observations, (ii) ground-based radar-derived QPE, (iii) satellite-derived QPE, (iv) griddedPARTRIDGE ET AL.7 of 27 20491948, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wat2.1728, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

Biases in QPE can arise from several sources of potential error. Precipitationgage networks are often too sparse to capture spatial patterns (e.g., Murphy et al., 2017), radar coverage is subject to ter-rain blocking (e.g., Germann et al., 2022; Maddox et al., 2002), and simulated precipitation from atmospheric models islimited by model resolution and cloud microphysics parameterization (e.g., Aligo et al., 2009; Giorgi & Marinucci, 1996;Morrison et al., 2020). Many of these limitations are more pronounced during extreme events and/or over complex ter-rain, both of which are highly relevant for understanding and predicting post-wildfire hydrologic hazards. Over moun-tainous areas in the western US, true uncertainties in QPE are likely higher than differences between datasets (Hennet al., 2018). Different QPE datasets have unique trade-offs in terms of accuracy, resolution, and completeness, poten-tially complicating selecting the most appropriate precipitation-forcing dataset for a specific post-wildfire modelingapplication. Study objectives may guide the modeling framework and applicability of different precipitation datasets(Table 1). However, understanding the strengths and limitations of available precipitation data is crucial for inter-preting and communicating model results, especially as hydrologic models become more sophisticated and the numberof available forcing datasets continues to increase.In this advanced review, we synthesize existing literature evaluating the sensitivity of hydrologic models in burnedand unburned settings to precipitation-forcing data to highlight challenges and opportunities for precipitation forcingin post-wildfire model applications. We first outline common objectives and approaches to post-wildfire hydrologicmodeling and discuss their unique forcing data requirements. We then discuss the trade-offs associated with variousprecipitation datasets and provide considerations for data selection when designing post-wildfire hydrologic modelingstudies. Finally, we report on potential opportunities for future research, data collection, and data synthesis approacheswhich could advance post-wildfire hydrologic modeling. While we focus on post-wildfire applications and precipitationdatasets from the western US, we draw from a range of studies, including some international, exploring the sensitivityof hydrologic and erosion models to selected precipitation forcing data. The results can be extended to other modelingefforts designed to assess hydrologic response to landscape disturbance.2|APPROACHES TO POST-WILDFIRE HYDROLOGIC MODELING2.1|Post-wildfire hydrologic modeling objectives and common challengesTypical post-wildfire hydrologic modeling objectives tend to fall into a few distinct categories (Table 1): (i) hazard fore-casting (e.g., Kean & Staley, 2021), (ii) water availability forecasting (e.g., Santos et al., 2015), (iii) surface andBOX 1Wildfire effects on water qualityWildfire-induced changes to runoff and erosion rates can lead to increased transport of sediment, ash, and con-taminants to streams, potentially degrading water quality and increasing drinking water treatment costs(Bladon et al., 2014). Similar to variable post-wildfire hydrologic response, water-quality effects vary consider-ably between wildfires, and may occur months to years after wildfire depending on the frequency, timing, andintensity of post-wildfire precipitation events (Murphy et al., 2015). Increased overland flow can lead to streamdischarge and sediment concentrations that are orders of magnitude larger than pre-wildfire conditions (Paulet al., 2022) and the mobilization of legacy contaminants (Murphy et al., 2020), nitrate (Riggan et al., 1994),phosphorous (Emelko et al., 2016), and other constituents (Rust et al., 2018). However, some wildfires lead tono noticeable effects in downstream water quality (Paul et al., 2022). The challenge of assessing and predictingpost-wildfire water-quality effects to ecosystems and downstream water supplies is further complicated by alack of high-resolution pre- and post-wildfire water-quality data, which are necessary for developing and cali-brating water-quality models, evaluating the efficacy of mitigation treatments, and assessing post-wildfirerecovery (Basso et al., 2022; Hampton et al., 2022; Robinne et al., 2022). Addressing the gaps in post-wildfirewater-quality data, and associated precipitation data, requires coordinated efforts and monitoring methodolo-gies to produce consistent datasets across diverse spatial and temporal scales and disparate precipitation clima-tologies (Murphy et al., 2023).PARTRIDGE ET AL.3 of 27 20491948, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wat2.1728, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

Nearly all hydrologic model-ing approaches, from data-driven models (e.g., Moody, 2012), including machine learning algorithms (e.g., Wilderet al., 2021; Zema, Lucas-Borja, et al., 2020), to fully distributed physically based models (e.g., Li et al., 2022), have beenutilized to explore some aspect of post-wildfire hydrology (Ebel et al., 2023; Lopes et al., 2021; Partington et al., 2022). Indi-vidual studies and models will likely have specific input data requirements, prediction assessment targets, and focus onunique processes, variables, and spatiotemporal scales. However, the typical scale and setting of wildfire lead to severalcommon precipitation-forcing data challenges (Figure 1). First, wildfires that will likely have the greatest impact onmunicipal water resources tend to occur in complex mountainous terrain near headwater streams, where precipitationdata tend to be most uncertain (Ouyang et al., 2021). These areas generally have relatively sparse precipitation gage net-works and high topographic relief, making it difficult to obtain accurate QPE (Ouyang et al., 2021). For example, ground-based radar may face deficiencies from terrain blocking (McRoberts & Nielsen-Gammon, 2017) and small-scale convectiveevents may be underrepresented in areas with sparse precipitation gage networks (Michaud & Sorooshian, 1994). Second,periods of high-intensity precipitation, even if it is highly localized, can have an outsized influence on post-wildfire runoffgeneration (Lane et al., 2006; Moody et al., 2008; Robichaud et al., 2016) and erosion (Lane et al., 2006; Moodyet al., 2008; Robichaud et al., 2016), with effects to water quality (Hohner et al., 2019; Murphy et al., 2015; Smithet al., 2011). Strategically placed precipitation gages may provide suitable data for assessing localized hazards, such asdebris flows, but capturing the spatial and temporal variability of high-intensity precipitation across scales is difficult.Hourly precipitation intensity estimates can differ by up to an order of magnitude between high resolution QPE datasets(Bytheway et al., 2020). Finally, wildfire can impact both the accumulation and ablation of snow (e.g., Kampf et al., 2022),with important implications for runoff (Penn et al., 2020; Smoot & Gleason, 2021), and flash flooding. Most gridded snowdepth and snow water equivalent datasets do not account for the effects of wildfire on snow processes (Box 2).A study's objectives will guide the modeling framework and associated forcing data (Table 1). Forecasting short-term hazards in an emergency response setting requires rapid model deployment to provide emergency response man-agers with timely information. Post-wildfire hazard forecasting models tend to be data-driven to reduce the need forlengthy calibration and processing times. For example, the US Geological Survey (USGS) Emergency Assessment ofDebris Flow Hazards model (Gartner et al., 2014; Staley et al., 2016) relies on prescribed 15-min precipitation intensityFIGURE 1Common precipitation data challenges in a post-wildfire model application: (a) Wildfires tend to occur in mountainousterrain which often have sparse precipitation gage networks. (b) Radar-derived precipitation estimates are affected by terrain blocking incomplex terrain. (c) Gridded snow data products typically do not account for wildfire effects on snow processes. (d) Post-wildfire hydrologiceffects are sensitive to high-intensity rainfall, which may be underrepresented in areas with sparse gage networks. (e) Streamflow generationmechanisms can shift after wildfire. Existing modeling frameworks might need to be altered to incorporate the increased influence ofrainfall intensity.PARTRIDGE ET AL.5 of 27 20491948, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wat2.1728, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

Stochastic weather generators, such as the CLImateGENerator (CLIGEN; Johnson et al., 1996), rely on simple climatological probabilities to generate meteorological vari-ables at certain timestep (e.g., daily) that are statistically consistent with observed data. For example, the hypotheticalprecipitation on a given day would depend on the long-term (typically 30 years) daily mean, daily standard deviation,and a daily skew coefficient (Wilks & Wilby, 1999).1. While statistically consistent with observed data, stochastically generated data are sensitive to inaccuracies in theobservational data, can struggle to accurately capture the length of dry and wet periods, and may not reflect shifts inprecipitation patterns due to climate change (Kim et al., 2023; F. Sun, Roderick, & Farquhar, 2018).2. Precipitation-based intensity–duration–frequency curves tend to assume all precipitation is liquid (i.e., immediatelyavailable for runoff), which can be problematic in cold environments (Sun et al., 2022). Standard precipitation-basedintensity–duration–frequency curves have been found to underestimate 100-year, 24-h extreme events at 45% ofSNOTEL stations (Yan et al., 2018).3. Most stochastic weather generators operate at the daily scale and will underrepresent important sub-daily precipita-tion peaks, such as 15-min precipitation intensity (e.g., McGuire et al., 2021), that can trigger post-wildfire floodsand debris flows. Recent sub-daily weather generators (e.g., Farhani et al., 2022) might be promising, but are stilluntested in post-wildfire settings.3.8|Selecting the appropriate QPE dataset for a model applicationSelecting the appropriate precipitation dataset for a given post-wildfire hydrologic modeling application will requireidentifying the spatial and temporal resolution needed to capture processes of interest and balancing uncertaintiesbetween differing datasets. For example, differences in scale between post-wildfire debris flows and floods likely resultin different forcing data considerations. Shorter accumulation intervals that capture localized precipitation intensity areimportant for debris flow prediction (e.g., 15-min precipitation rates) whereas longer duration accumulation may cap-ture the sustained rates likely needed to generate post-wildfire flooding, which tends to occur at a larger scale thandebris flows. Most fully distributed physically based models will require at least hourly data; however, daily or longerdata are still commonly used in many data-driven and conceptual hydrologic models (Table 1). While providing a com-prehensive evaluation of QPE data uncertainty is beyond the scope of this article, we briefly summarize previous studiesthat have evaluated or compared QPE datasets over the western US and reference available data comparisons and/orevaluations for several high-resolution (i.e., <0.1, sub-daily) datasets that could provide suitable input data for post-wildfire modeling applications (Table 3).Several studies have compared lower spatial and/or temporal resolution gridded precipitation data over complextopography in the United States (e.g., Ebert et al., 2007; Henn et al., 2018; Orland et al., 2022; Tarek et al., 2020) andglobally (e.g., Bartsotas et al., 2018; Tian & Peters-Lidard, 2010). Over complex terrain in the western US, gridded dailyQPE data can vary from 5% to 60% (over 200 mm/year) with substantial variability in multiyear trends (Hennet al., 2018). The relatively coarse spatial resolution of the QPE datasets evaluated in the aforementioned studies couldlimit their applicability for post-wildfire hydrologic modeling. Surprisingly few studies have focused on comparing orevaluating high-resolution QPE datasets. Beck et al. (2019) evaluated 26 high and moderate resolution precipitationdatasets against daily precipitation data from the NCEP Stage-IV dataset (Lin & Mitchell, 2005). While the best per-forming datasets, based on Kling–Gupta Efficiency (KGE) scores, were bias corrected using in situ observations, severaluncorrected QPE datasets from satellite-derived estimates and NWMs compared reasonably well with Stage-IV data. Ofthe high-resolution datasets listed in Table 3, the satellite-derived, bias-corrected Climate Prediction Center (CPC)MORPHing technique (CMORPH-CRT V1.0; Joyce et al., 2004) exhibited the highest median KGE scores and some ofthe lowest biases (Beck et al., 2019). Model output from a convection-permitting WRF regional climate model simula-tion (Liu et al., 2017) closely matched Stage-IV data in terms of precipitation variability and total precipitation, espe-cially over the western US. Simulated precipitation from well-configured high-resolution models, such as the recentlyreleased CONUS404 dataset (Rasmussen et al., 2023), could be suitable as input for hydrologic model applications overmountainous terrain (Lundquist et al., 2019). Bytheway et al. (2020) compared 10 gridded hourly, high spatial resolu-tion datasets over northern California. They found relative agreement between the datasets on precipitation timing but14 of 27PARTRIDGE ET AL. 20491948, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wat2.1728, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

The relative performance of any QPE dataset will most likely vary with season, climate, topog-raphy, and spatial and temporal variations in source data characteristics. This complicates the transferability of QPEevaluations between regions and applications. Further research could explore the differences and limitations of existinghigh-resolution QPE datasets (i.e., sub-daily; <0.1 spatial resolution) across regions and weather events.4|OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTThere are several exciting opportunities for advancing the collection, synthesis, and simulation of precipitation-forcingdata that could advance post-wildfire hydrologic modeling. The most straightforward opportunity—increasing the den-sity of precipitation gages in wildfire-prone areas—is also perhaps the most complicated given the expense, logistical,and labor challenges associated with installing and maintaining weather stations. There has been a rapid increase inthe number of homes and business built within the wildland–urban interface (WUI) since 1990 (Radeloff et al., 2018);while substantially increasing the risk of wildfire (Radeloff et al., 2023), the number of personally operated weather sta-tions within the WUI has likely also increased. Organizations like the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and SnowNetwork (CoCoRaHS), the National Weather Service's Citizens Weather Observer Program, and CommunitySnow Observations (http://communitysnowobs.org/) are established resources for collecting and integrating data frompersonal weather stations into national data products. Citizen Science programs like these have been useful for provid-ing ground truthing of QPE phase data (e.g., Chen et al., 2016; Elmore et al., 2014; Jennings et al., 2023), and could helpincrease the density of weather data in wildfire-prone areas. Collecting sub-daily precipitation data through citizen sci-ence programs would be a valuable contribution, and accounting for maintenance and quality control measures wouldimprove data usability for the post-wildfire community. Locating weather stations in remote, small headwater is signifi-cantly more challenging and will likely require targeted and coordinated efforts between federal and state governments,universities, and non-governmental agencies. There is a rich literature surrounding monitoring gage optimizationapproaches, including optimizing precipitation and streamflow gages in small headwater systems (e.g., Chacon-Hurtadoet al., 2017; Michelon et al., 2021). However, relatively few studies have used hydrologic model performance as a crite-rion for network design (Chacon-Hurtado et al., 2017), and it is not clear how, or if, land use disturbances like wildfiremay impact optimization approaches. Given the challenges associated with instrument deployment and maintenance,future studies investigating monitoring network optimization in burned areas through the lens of improving post-wildfire hydrologic modeling would likely be beneficial when designing and planning additional gage deployment.Substantial progress has been made in monitoring, assessing, and predicting post-wildfire flash flood and debrisflows (e.g., Kean et al., 2011; Kean et al., 2012); however, there are major limitations in the prediction and assessmentof post-wildfire water-quality effects (Murphy et al., 2023). A recent call for increased post-wildfire water-quality dataincludes several considerations with relevance to precipitation data, specifically future monitoring efforts could focuson: (i) collecting high-frequency (i.e., sub-daily) precipitation data, which are necessary for understanding the relation-ship between extreme events and water quality, (ii) selecting basins with little to no water management infrastructure,(iii) selecting basins with a minimum burned area of 10%, and (iv) selecting basins with available pre-wildfire data or acomparable unburned basin (Murphy et al., 2023).Climate reanalysis data and gridded observations from interpolated weather stations and weather radar provide avaluable, but seldom-used estimate (Ebel et al., 2023) of precipitation and temperature over data-sparse regions inpost-wildfire water quantity modeling. The coarse resolution of many reanalysis products can be problematic overwildfire-prone, small-scale catchments, and the daily timestep of most gridded observations prohibits their use inassessing post-wildfire debris flows and floods. New datasets such as CONUS404 (Rasmussen et al., 2023) and AnalysisOf Record for Calibration (AORC; Kitzmiller et al., 2018) can reduce uncertainty, increase spatiotemporal resolutions,and provide insight over data-sparse regions, but additional work evaluating the accuracy of high-resolution QPEdatasets is needed. Embracing uncertainty in precipitation observations through developing ensemble-based forcingdatasets may be another option for exploring the hydrologic response to wildfire and quantifying the probability ofpotential post-wildfire effects. Monte-Carlo based approaches are commonly used to explore uncertainty in the modelparameter space (e.g., Breuer et al., 2009; Seibert et al., 2010), yet extending similar approaches to explore forcing datauncertainty is relatively rare in post-wildfire hydrologic model applications. Similarly, it has been well documented thatuncertainty in precipitation data can result in significant model output error, yet further work is needed to understandPARTRIDGE ET AL.15 of 27 20491948, 0, Downloaded from https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wat2.1728, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

DataRiver basins and channel locations, extending to small first‐order streams, were determined based on the MERITHydro data set (Yamazaki et al., 2019). In this data set, a river basin is defined by its outlet to the ocean, so there isonly one outlet per basin. Included in this study are river basins with outlets in the state of Alaska, excluding theAleutian Islands and Southeastern Alaska. To filter out the small coastal streams, only river basins with at least 10hydrological response units (HRUs) were retained. These criteria were met by 138 unique river basins acrossAlaska (Figure 2), comprising more than 34,000 HRUs.Observed river temperature and discharge data were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS)National Water Information System (U.S. Geological Survey, 2022). Only gages with more than 8 years of databetween 2013 and 2021 were used for model optimization and validation. Only river discharge data that were 90%complete over this period were included resulting in 27 gages used for validation (Figure 2). Availability of rivertemperature data is less consistent, so each gage that covered this period was visually inspected for completenessresulting in 18 gages used for optimization and validation (Figure 2). Both river temperature and discharge dataare quality controlled by the USGS before they are published (Wagner et al., 2006). Only one gage had a completeset of temperature data for the period but did not have complete discharge data. Gage information is provided inTable S1.A range of Mohseni parameters was developed by comparing USGS river temperature data for ice‐free monthsfrom gages that had less than 100 km2 of contributing area to near surface air temperature data produced by theclimate model (Table 1). Field notes from USGS river gage technicians were used to establish a range of Leopoldparameters and channel geometry (Table 1). Discharge, velocity, and river width were reported, and the averagedepth was calculated using the continuity equation. All USGS data were accessed using the dataRetrieval packagein R Statistical Software v4.2.1 (DeCicco et al., 2023; R Core Team, 2022).Regional differences in these parameters were observed, resulting in the model being divided into three regions:North, Central, and South (Figure 2). The regional boundaries were based on the hydrologic regions of Alaska asdetermined by the USGS but were further constrained by data availability. Of the 18 gages, nine were randomlyselected using a random number generator to serve as optimization, ensuring at least two optimization gages ineach region, and the other nine were reserved for validation (Figure 2). A baseline model was run using themedian value of each of these parameters for each region.2.4.

High Resolution River Temperature SimulationThe model was run with the optimized regional parameter sets for 138 basins across Alaska and the Yukon Riverbasin to generate a continuous river temperature hindcast from 1 January 1990 to 30 September 2021. The modelwas only optimized and validated for the ice‐free months. The mean river temperature across Alaska during theice‐free months was 8.3°C (Figure 8). The average maximum temperature was 14.3°C, the minimum was 1.7°C,and the variance was 8.2°C2. Rivers in the North region had higher maximum temperatures (16.5°C) compared tothe Central and South regions (14.0 and 13.6°C, respectively), which is similar to observed data at USGS gages(Figure S3 in Supporting Information S1). The lowest maximum temperatures occurred in headwater streams(13.7°C). The Central Region had the highest mean water temperature (8.5°C).4. DiscussionBy utilizing the RASM at 4‐km resolution, optimizing both land surface and river temperature models, andconducting the first large‐scale sensitivity analysis of the RBM in the Arctic, we successfully generated a highlyaccurate, high‐resolution hindcast of river discharge and temperature for 138 basins across Alaska. The modeloptimization proved effective, reducing error below the baseline and statistical benchmark model, highlightingthe success of this optimization strategy. Furthermore, the benchmark statistical model exhibited superior per-formance over baseline parameter values in RBM, emphasizing the utility of applying only optimized physicalmodels rather than “default” parameters taken from the literature and applied to this region. Notably, thesimplified statistical model may be adequate for modeling smaller streams with limited advective influences andlimited shallow groundwater inputs due to permafrost.Modeling Arctic river temperatures presents challenges due to snowmelt‐driven peak discharge coinciding withthe highest annual water temperatures, altering the relationship between water and air temperatures (van Vlietet al., 2011). In Alaska, shortwave radiation and air temperature have been identified as the dominant influenceson river temperatures, justifying the adoption of RBM—a model expressly designed to accommodate theseprocesses (Chikita et al., 2010; King & Neilson, 2019; Yearsley, 2009). Additionally, high‐resolution modelingusing atmospheric and land surface models specifically designed for snowmelt runoff in permafrost zones mayhelp to capture this dynamic. Moreover, hyporheic exchange during low flows, a phenomenon not explicitlyaddressed in RBM, has been demonstrated to affect Arctic river temperatures (Cozzetto et al., 2013; King &Neilson, 2019; Yearsley, 2009). Given that the lowest flows in the model coincide with the boundaries where rivertemperatures are prescribed, the model optimization inherently considers and accounts for this process.Statistical and physical models have been employed to understand river temperatures in the Arctic, ranging fromreach‐scale to global simulations. Whereas reach‐scale estimates can achieve a high degree of accuracy (RMSE<1°C), global simulations often struggle to accurately represent the Arctic region (RMSE >4°C) (Chikitaet al., 2010; King & Neilson, 2019; Wanders et al., 2019).

Regional Difference in Model Parameters and OutputsIn the North, rivers are simulated to have the highest maximum river temperatures. The underperformance of thebenchmark statistical model in the North suggests that air temperature is not the dominant influencer of rivertemperature. Rather, water temperature in Northern rivers is primarily shaped by incoming shortwave andlongwave radiation (Zheng et al., 2019), a phenomenon aptly captured by RBM. Notably, the North regiondisplayed greater sensitivity to Leopold parameters related to river geometry, impacting water velocity and theriver's thermal sink capacity (Leach et al., 2023). The shallower Northern rivers can experience significantwarming due to radiation, exceeding air temperatures (Cozzetto et al., 2006; Zheng et al., 2019). The presence ofcontinuous permafrost underlying Northern rivers also keeps groundwater close to the surface, resulting in thewarming of headwater streams (Sjöberg et al., 2021).Conversely, high elevation streams in the South had the lowest simulated maximum water temperatures. In thisregion, the prevalence of late snowmelt runoff and glacial melt contributes to consistently cooler stream tem-peratures even as air temperatures rise during the summer (Bieniek et al., 2014; Brown & Hannah, 2008;Crossman et al., 2013; Curran & Biles, 2021). Although air temperature typically correlates with river temper-ature, this relationship breaks down in snowmelt and glacier‐dominated areas potentially leading to over-estimations in modeled stream temperatures (Ferchichi & St‐Hilaire, 2023; Ficklin et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2021).Additionally, the shorter length of South region rivers, as compared to those in the North and Central regions,allows headwater boundary conditions to propagate extensively (van Vliet et al., 2012), possibly contributing tothe pronounced influence of the boundary condition in this region. The Mohseni equation parameters used in theboundary condition, which indirectly factors in these dynamics through its non‐linear formulation (Mohseniet al., 1998), were the most sensitive parameters in South's river temperature modeling.Across all three regions, the Mohseni parameter μ, representing the lower bound of the headwater boundarytemperature, emerged as the most sensitive parameter. While theoretically, this value should be 0°C, localconditions such as groundwater inputs, runoff, lake and reservoir effects, and solar radiation can maintain riversegments above freezing even as air temperatures drop below 0°C (Mohseni et al., 1998). Since model optimi-zation was conducted for the ice‐free months the optimized value of μ was always greater than 0°C.4.2. Importance of Model Structure, Parameterization, and Forcing DataThere are three major sources of error within RBM: model structure, parameterization, and forcing data. RBMonly solves surface energy fluxes and advection. The one‐dimensional nature of the model also neglects thermalgradients within the water column. Groundwater and hyporheic exchange are major controls on river tempera-tures that are not directly considered in RBM. In northern Alaska, shallow, suprapermafrost groundwater warmsstreams, while in other areas not underlain by continuous permafrost, groundwater will cool streams (Leach &Moore, 2019; Sjöberg et al., 2021). In first order streams, groundwater is the primary driver of water temperature,but this is also where the boundary conditions exhibit the greatest influence in RBM (Caissie, 2006; van Vlietet al., 2013). The Mohseni equation indirectly accounts for groundwater input affecting river temperature throughits non‐linearity (Mohseni et al., 1998). Furthermore, our river modeling system does not explicitly consider thethermal regulation of lakes, which has limited local effects at regional scales (Isaak et al., 2017). Instead, it relieson the Mohseni equation at the upstream boundary to account for this thermal regulation (Mohseni et al., 1998).Given that air temperature and shortwave radiation are the primary drivers of river temperature, the most sig-nificant source of error not addressed in the model is the meteorological difference between the grid cell and theair‐water interface (Chikita et al., 2010; Guenther et al., 2012).The model parameterizes channel geometry and the headwater boundary condition, which can lead to errors sinceriver temperature models are sensitive to parameterization (Piotrowski & Napiorkowski, 2018). Our model,operating on a high‐resolution river network, will consistently have headwater streams flowing into the mainchannel influencing river temperature, so the boundary conditions are highly influential (van Vliet et al., 2013),which differs from the modeling of small river segments (Wondzell et al., 2019). Our sensitivity analysis showsthat parameterization, especially of the boundary conditions, is the primary error within the model.Parameterization of the boundary conditions and channel geometry was conducted over three geographical re-gions, but there was significant variability within those regions. For example, two rivers in the Central region didnot share an optimal set of parameters despite their proximity. One river is characterized by its substantial size,Water Resources Research10.1029/2023WR036217BLASKEY ET AL.14 of 19 19447973, 2024, 4, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036217, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

In this study, we use physically based river routing and temperature models tosimulate daily discharge and river temperature for rivers in 138 basins in Alaska, including the entire YukonRiver basin, from 1990–2021. The river temperature model was optimized for ice free months using a surrogate‐based model optimization method, improving model performance at uncalibrated river gages. A commonstatistical model relating local air and water temperature was used as a benchmark. The physically based rivertemperature model exhibited superior performance compared to the benchmark statistical model afteroptimization, suggesting river temperature model optimization could become more routine. The rivertemperature model demonstrated high sensitivity to air temperature and model parameterization, and lowersensitivity to discharge. Validation of the models showed a Kling‐Gupta Efficiency of 0.46 for daily riverdischarge and a root mean square error of 2.04°C for daily river temperature, improving on the non‐optimizedphysical model and the benchmark statistical model, which had root mean square errors of 3.24 and 2.97°C,respectively. The simulation shows that rivers in northern Alaska have higher maximum summer temperaturesand more variability than rivers in the Central and Southern regions. Furthermore, this framework can be readilyadapted for use across models and regions.Plain Language Summary Accurate data on the volume and temperature of river water are essentialfor understanding how changing river conditions affect water quality and freshwater ecosystems. However,direct measurements of river parameters are often lacking, leading researchers to rely on models for estimation.In this study, we utilized advanced models and techniques to compute daily water volume and temperature in138 basins across Alaska, including the entirety of the Yukon River basin, spanning from 1990 to 2021. Ourfindings indicated that rivers in northern Alaska exhibited higher maximum summer water temperatures andmore significant temperature fluctuations compared to those in the central and southern regions. Our analysishighlighted that adjusting air temperature and the model's internal variables were crucial in minimizing errors inriver temperature prediction. We improved the accuracy of the river temperature model by applying a techniqueto refine the model output based on the limited available river measurements. Comparing our enhanced model toa simpler statistical approach, we observed superior performance once the necessary adjustments wereimplemented.1. IntroductionAir temperatures in Alaska are increasing four times faster than the global average (Rantanen et al., 2022). Therise in air temperature has led to substantial thawing of permafrost and glaciers, increased winter snowmelt,altered subsurface flow patterns, and shifted river seasonality (Blaskey et al., 2023; Koch et al., 2022; Liet al., 2022; Musselman et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2020). Water temperature in Alaska's largest rivers has alsoincreased, impacting water quality, the growth rate and distribution of freshwater species, and biogeochemicalcycling (Kaushal et al., 2010; Tornabene et al., 2020; Wanders et al., 2019; von Biela et al., 2022). For example,record‐breaking air temperatures and drought in 2019 caused widespread mortality among returning salmon in theYukon River (von Biela et al., 2022). The combination of low discharge and high water temperatures can preventmigrating salmon from accessing pools of colder water needed for survival (Frechette et al., 2018).

Each basin was run using the optimized parameter set for the region. The basins were separatedinto their geographic region by their outlet point (Figure 2). While the river routing model was not directlyoptimized, the runoff produced by the land surface model CTSM was previously routed and optimized againstUSGS discharge observations for selected basins in Alaska (Cheng et al., 2023; Lawrence et al., 2019). Allmodeling was conducted on the NCAR Cheyenne supercomputer (Computational and Information SystemsLaboratory, 2019).3. Results3.1. River Routing ValidationThe median KGE calculated for daily discharge using the validation gages across the full study domain was 0.45for the ice‐free months and a KGE of 0.47 with a percent bias of −4.6% annually. The results are shown spatiallyin Figure S1 in Supporting Information S1. When assessed by month, May had the highest median KGE (0.36)and July had the lowest (0.19) (Figure 3). The percent bias shifted seasonally from a median negative bias in May(underestimating discharge by 26%) to a median positive bias in September (overestimating discharge by 22%)(Figure 3).3.2. River Temperature Model ValidationThe river temperature optimization process required 20 iterations (600 total model runs) to produce the optimizedparameter values (Table S2 in Supporting Information S1). The surrogate model RMSE was 0.78°C. Overall, theoptimization improved the RMSE of RBM from 3.24 to 2.04°C during the validation period, with a range of 1.10–3.18°C. After optimization, river temperature simulations were substantially improved in all three regions(Table 2). The Central region exhibited the most improvement, while the South region had the lowest overallerror. Among the gages used for optimization, the model performance improved in eight of the nine gages,resulting in an average decrease from 3.27 to 1.78°C. Additionally, theoptimization improved temperature simulations at six of nine gages that werenot used in the optimization decreasing the average RMSE from 3.20 to 2.31°C. All three gages located in different river basins than the optimization pointsshowed substantial performance improvements with optimization, reducingthe average RMSE from 4.72 to 2.18°C.The optimized model was compared to the baseline model and a benchmarkstatistical model (Figure 4). The statistical model had an optimization RMSEof 2.2°C and a validation RMSE of 2.97°C. At >75% of the gages, theoptimized model outperformed both the statistical model (15 of 18 gages) andFigure 3.

In May, some rivers still contain ice, keeping the river temperatures closeto 0°C, while the model predicts higher temperatures. This results in a slight warm bias in the model. The meanoverall difference between simulated and observed river temperatures is 0.46°C (range 0.28–0.96°C by month),with a standard deviation of 2.08°C (range 1.81–2.34°C by month).In the optimized model, there was significant variation within the regions. For example, two rivers in the Centralregion, the Chena and Tanana, did not share a set of parameters that increased model performance for both rivers,each river performed better at the other gage's expense. The optimized parameter values for the Central regionproduced a better fit for the Tanana River and a worse fit in the Chena River, causing it to underperform againstthe benchmark (Figure 7). The validation of the optimized model is shown spatially in Figure S2 in SupportingInformation S1. Model performance also varied by river size. There was only one first order stream in thevalidation set, which underperformed the statistical model (RMSE of 1.18 vs. 2.22°C). There was an optimizationgage with a slightly higher RMSE (1.87°C) on a fourth order river downstream of this first order stream gage. Asecond order stream was an optimization point in a basin with a fourth order stream validation point, resulting insimilar performance (1.14 and 1.10°C, respectively). The seventh order lower Yukon River is the largest river inthe data set. At this gage, the optimized model performed well (RMSE of 2.69°C), where the benchmark modelhad its worst performance (RMSE of 6.33°C).3.3. RBM Sensitivity AnalysisThe average daily temperature error of the optimized RBM changes 0.31 per 1°C change in air temperature andthe maximum seasonal temperature error changes 0.88 per 1°C in air temperature. Changes in discharge resultedin an average error change of 0.01°C per 10% change in discharge for daily averaged water temperatures and0.09°C per 10% change in discharge for seasonal maximum water temperature.Parameter sensitivity was obtained from the surrogate model. The only consistently sensitive parameter was μ(Figure 7), the lower bound of calculated water temperature for the boundary condition, which resulted in theFigure 5.

Thisindicates that geography is not the only factor affecting model parameter choice. Other hydrologic features suchas glaciers and snowmelt can also affect the headwater boundary conditions (Yan et al., 2021). These variables aswell as elevation and river morphology were explored as alternatives to the geography‐based separation of pa-rameters, but there are only a limited number of USGS river temperature gages in headwater streams, whichprevented separating river segments based on these variables. More long‐term data and analysis may improveunderstanding of the effect that optimization across these variables would have on model performance.River size may also be a factor in the model parameterization. The optimization gages encompass rivers rangingfrom second through fifth order, and over half of the optimization gages are in fourth order rivers. These rivers areusually larger and warmer than the headwaters as radiation and advection become the primary drivers of tem-perature (Fabris et al., 2020). It is within this range of river sizes that the model consistently displayed its optimalperformance. In headwater streams, the model showed mixed results. In the sole first order stream used invalidation, the model underperformed the benchmark statistical model, but still performs similar to average valuesof other river temperature models (van Vliet et al., 2013; Wanders et al., 2019). For the two available second orderstreams used as optimization points, both demonstrated superior performance compared to the benchmark model.In contrast, the Yukon River, classified as a seventh‐order river, exceeded the largest optimization gage in theregion by two stream orders, yet it yielded highly promising results, affirming the model's applicability to largerrivers. The performance disparity between the optimized model and the benchmark underscores the pivotal role ofadvection in influencing the thermal dynamics of these larger rivers. Such a finding also indicates the accuracy ofupstream river temperatures in the simulation, as inaccuracies introduced in the upstream segments have thepotential to magnify downstream.Forcing data from the climate and land surface model represent the last major source of error within the model.Biases in the input data could propagate through the model chain, which might not be compensated by theparameter optimization. van Vliet et al. (2012) demonstrated that errors in discharge of 50% could result insignificantly different errors within RBM for maximum water temperatures. We found similar changes in error inresponse to perturbing discharge. We also evaluated air temperature and found that it had a much larger impact onmodel error than river discharge. This aligns with field studies of river temperature that have concluded that solarinputs and air temperature were the primary drivers of river temperature (Bolduc & Lamoureux, 2018), whiledischarge has a minor effect after a certain minimum flow is reached (Cheng et al., 2020; Gu et al., 1998). Thissuggests why the errors in the river routing model (mean KGE = 0.46) do not significantly affect the rivertemperature model.4.3. Modeled River Temperatures and Fish HealthRiver temperature models are vital to assess thermal regimes in rivers, particularly for fish and other aquaticorganisms whose physiological processes are influenced by water temperature (Durance & Ormerod, 2009;Pörtner & Farrell, 2008). Organisms thrive within specific temperature ranges, but these bounds can vary by asmuch as 2–3°C within species at the same life stage in the same river, and even more significantly over largergeographical regions (Coutant, 1999; Pörtner & Farrell, 2008). Before optimization, RBM performance felloutside the range of natural variability within species. However, after optimizing the model, the error decreased to2.04°C, indicating that it now aligns with the natural fluctuation of suitable conditions and thus is appropriate foraddressing questions related to the impact of river temperature on fish health. This demonstrates the effectivenessof the offline coupling of mizuRoute and RBM, as well as the optimization workflow, in accurately simulatingriver discharge and temperature using inputs generated by a regional climate model. Such modeling effortssupport understanding the impact of climate change on fish species and provide valuable insights into thermalthresholds within and across rivers.5. ConclusionsOur study presents the first high‐resolution river discharge and temperature hindcast for rivers in Alaska and theYukon River basin from 1990 to 2021, utilizing a novel coupling of mizuRoute and RBM forced by a 4 kmregional climate model and land surface model. The sensitivity analysis conducted on RBM underlines the criticalimportance of precise input data, particularly air temperature data, and parameter optimization.

Despite these ongoing changes and the resulting socioeconomic impacts, observation andmodeling data of Alaskan river temperatures are rare.River temperatures are spatially and temporally heterogeneous (Steel et al., 2017) primarily due to atmosphericand terrestrial energy fluxes. These fluxes are controlled by topography, groundwater inputs, hyporheic exchange,river stratification, flow velocity, and vegetation (Burkholder et al., 2008; Dugdale et al., 2015, 2017; Nielsenet al., 1994). However, capturing this heterogeneity is difficult because observational river temperature data arelimited with typically low spatial and temporal resolutions (Watts et al., 2015). Therefore, river temperaturemodels are frequently used to understand large‐scale river temperature patterns and its physical drivers due totheir continuous spatial and temporal data (Ruesch et al., 2012; Tung et al., 2006).Many river temperature simulations rely solely on land surface models, lacking dynamic coupling between theland and atmosphere (e.g., Sun et al., 2015). However, coupled land and atmospheric models could enhanceaccuracy by providing a comprehensive representation of Arctic system processes (Lawrence et al., 2019).Furthermore, an enhanced physical representation of landscapes and land‐atmosphere interactions bolsters thecredibility of models in regional applications and community use (Giorgi, 2019). Climate and Earth Systemmodels are increasingly operating at higher spatial resolutions to improve physical process representation,addressing factors such as convection and orographic impacts (Reder et al., 2020). Despite these advancements,the optimization of parameters within complex Land Models lags due to uncertainties, structural errors, andmissing process representations (Lehner et al., 2019). Alaska is a difficult region to model and is prone to higherrors in both land surface and river temperature modeling due to sea ice dynamics, heterogenous permafrost,snow, complex terrain, and limited data (Cheng et al., 2023; Monaghan et al., 2018; Wanders et al., 2019). TheRegional Arctic System Model (RASM) has been developed specifically for cold regions, so it excels in capturingdiverse topography, realistically simulating seasonal snow, orographic precipitation patterns, and heterogeneouspermafrost (Lawrence et al., 2019).In river temperature modeling, errors cascade through modeling chains from the land surface model, throughdischarge model, and then to the river temperature model (van Vliet et al., 2012). Without highly accurate andhigh‐resolution input data, errors surpass the subtle fluctuations in water temperature critical to sensitive aquaticorganisms, rendering the data less useful (Tisseuil et al., 2012; van Vliet et al., 2013; Wanders et al., 2019). Forinstance, salmon, have a maximum thermal limit of around 18°C, but this limit varies by 2–3°C within the speciesat the same life stage (Coutant, 1999; Mayer et al., 2023; Pörtner & Farrell, 2008). Few models can operate withinthis error tolerance from headwaters to the mouth of the river, which is needed to capture the thermal effects onmigratory fish species (Lee et al., 2020). Even with highly accurate, high‐resolution input data, river temperaturemodels may fail to achieve this level of sensitivity due to boundary conditions and model parameterization (vanVliet et al., 2013; Wanders et al., 2019). Optimization is a prevalent strategy used in hydrologic modeling studiesto mitigate errors in hydrological and land surface modeling research (Bonyadi & Michalewicz, 2017; Boussaïdet al., 2013; Cheng et al., 2023; Das et al., 2016; Tayfur, 2017). Nevertheless, the application of these techniquesto river temperature models has remained relatively uncommon.In this study, we create a chain of models to simulate river temperature in Alaskan rivers from 1990 to 2021. Ourapproach leverages the 4‐km resolution RASM, which dynamically couples an atmospheric model with a landsurface model specifically optimized to improve for cold region hydrology (Cheng et al., 2023). The model'sprocess representation combined with its high resolution enables accurate representation of orographic effects,permafrost hydrology, and snow dynamics. River modeling utilized the river routing model, mizuRoute (Miz-ukami et al., 2016, 2022), in conjunction with the river temperature model, the River Basin Model (RBM,Yearsley, 2009, 2012). We conducted the first large‐scale sensitivity analysis on RBM in Arctic regions todetermine the most sensitive model parameters. We then optimized the model and compared it to a widely usedstatistical river temperature model for a benchmark to assess performance of our baseline and optimized phys-ically based models, providing a more rigorous assessment of our model performance (e.g., Abramowitz, 2005;Best et al., 2015; Newman et al., 2017).This approach, with its high‐resolution climate input and comprehensive modeling framework, allows for animproved representation of the hydrological and thermal conditions occurring in the region as compared to theunoptimized and benchmark models. Notably, our model framework achieves highly accurate river temperaturesfrom headwaters to mouth at high resolutions across the state reducing errors to within the thermal variability ofWater Resources Research10.1029/2023WR036217BLASKEY ET AL.2 of 19 19447973, 2024, 4, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036217, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

The output from the modeling chain can provide the datanecessary to understand the rapid changes in freshwater ecosystems that have occurred over the last 30 years (Okeet al., 2020).2. MethodsRunoff from a coupled land‐atmosphere RASM simulation was routed through mizuRoute to produce riverdischarge data. The discharge data along with the simulated meteorology from RASM were then used as input forRBM to simulate river temperature (Figure 1). Coupling of the river models was done “offline” meaning that eachmodel was run completely before its output data were used as input in the subsequent model. The RBM wasoptimized using a Gaussian Process Regression surrogate model and the Non‐dominated Sorting Genetic Al-gorithm II (NSGA‐II, Deb et al., 2002) to generate model parameters. The optimized model system was run tosimulate a 30‐year historical period (1990–2021) for Alaskan rivers.2.1. The Modeling System2.1.1. Regional Arctic System Model (RASM)We employed RASM, which dynamically couples the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF, Skamarocket al., 2019) atmospheric model with the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM, Lawrence et al., 2019).Configuration of RASM for this regional application is described in more detail in Cheng et al. (2023). Notably,CTSM was optimized for streamflow and snow water equivalent in an offline manner and the optimizedparameter set (Cheng et al., 2023) was subsequently used in RASM to generate a coupled, multi‐decadal regionalclimate simulation. An iterative testing and re‐optimization strategy was deployed to make sure the offlineoptimized parameters would not deteriorate the performance of the coupled models. Optimization for streamflowin a regional climate model is rare, and, to our knowledge, this is the first such effort in an Arctic region. Sub‐dailyhydrometeorological data were produced by RASM forced by downscaled ERA5 reanalysis for the domain for1990–2021 at 4 km spatial resolution. Ocean and sea ice conditions were specified from ERA5 (MuñozSabater, 2019) to enhance the realism of Arctic weather simulations. Sub‐daily data were temporally aggregatedFigure 1. Flowchart of the chain of models and their interactions. While the water temperature regression is denoted as a separate model from the river temperaturemodel, the River Basin Model includes a module to run the temperature regression to determine the headwater boundary conditions. The figure was adapted fromYearsley (2012, Figure 2).Water Resources Research10.1029/2023WR036217BLASKEY ET AL.3 of 19 19447973, 2024, 4, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036217, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

Notably, while a benchmark statistical river temperaturemodel outperformed the unoptimized RBM at more than half of the gages, it underperformed in comparison to theoptimized RBM, thereby emphasizing the pivotal role of model optimization. The regional variations in modelperformance strongly highlight the need for tailored approaches that consider local conditions. The sensitivityanalysis indicates important drivers of river temperatures in each region and how they differ across the state.Ultimately, the comprehensive river discharge and temperature hindcast provides an invaluable resource forgaining insights into long‐term river temperature patterns. For instance, the findings reveal that northern riversexhibit the highest maximum water temperatures and display the greatest variability throughout the study period,which is consistent with observations. These river temperature fluctuations can have significant ecological im-plications for freshwater ecosystems, which will continue to be altered by a changing climate. The hindcast datacan potentially be applied to ecological assessment, policy development, and climate change research.Data Availability StatementmizuRoute (Mizukami et al., 2022) and RBM (Blaskey, 2024a) were used to produce the full simulation results(Blaskey, 2023) after the model underwent optimization (Blaskey, 2024b).

Our modeling system met andsurpassed the mean error achieved by these regional models despite the complex Arctic hydrology. The resultingcomprehensive framework, incorporating high‐resolution climate data from a regional climate and land surfacemodel that has been calibrated on snowpack and discharge observations, establishes a new standard for accuratelysimulating river temperatures in Arctic rivers. Our results surpass previous model skill metrics and providecritical insights into the dynamic changes in freshwater ecosystems over the past three decades (Chenget al., 2023; Niemeyer et al., 2018; van Vliet et al., 2012, 2013; Wanders et al., 2019; Yearsley, 2012).Figure 8.

The optimization was performed based on the workflow estab-lished by Cheng et al. (2023), which detailed the optimization of the landsurface model used in the model system described here. In the current study,we perform the optimization of the river temperature model. Instead of theNash‐Sutcliffe Efficiency, we used the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ofmean daily stream temperature as the objective function, which is morecommon in river temperature analysis. Initially, 200 parameter combinationswere sampled using the Latin Hyper Square (LHS, McKay et al., 2000)method across the parameter space, and the objective function was calculatedfor each combination.After the initial sampling, the rivers were separated into the three regions. AGaussian Process Regression model was trained as a surrogate model todetermine the response of the objective function across the parameter spacefor each region. The Non‐dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA‐II,Deb et al., 2002) was then employed on the surrogate model to sample 20 newoptimal parameter sets for each region in the next iteration. Each iterationutilized all samples from the initial sampling and all previous iterations of thatregion to train a new surrogate model. Iterations were stopped when there wasminimal improvement in model performance. In total, 20 iterations wereconducted, resulting in 600 samples for each region. K‐fold cross‐validation(k = 5) was employed to assess the accuracy of the surrogate model, comparing the RMSE of the simulatedobjectives from the surrogate model with the objectives calculated from RBM results.The optimization was performed using data for years 2014–2017. 1 January 2013 to 30 April 2014, was used asthe spin‐up period for the model. Given that river water temperature resets close to 0°C each winter, a relativelyshort spin‐up time was sufficient for this model. The optimization was conducted only for ice‐free months: May–September for the South and Central regions, and June–September for the North. This difference is due to later icebreakup in the North.2.5. Sensitivity AnalysisThe model was evaluated for its sensitivity to input air temperature and discharge. The model was run multipletimes, perturbing each input. Temperature was adjusted by −2, −1, 1, and 2°C and the modeled error of averagedaily river temperature and maximum seasonal river temperature per degree change in air temperature wasevaluated. Similarly, discharge was varied using 80%, 90%, 110%, and 120% of discharge, and the modeled rivertemperature error per 10% change in discharge was evaluated.The sensitivity of model parameters was assessed using the surrogate model. After all iterations, the surrogatemodel was used to determine the response of the objective function to each parameter. By fixing all other pa-rameters at their median values and varying only the target parameter, a two‐dimensional response curve for eachparameter was generated. The difference between the maximum and minimum error of the response curve wasused as the error factor for each parameter, with higher values indicating a greater change in the model error as aresult of adjusting the parameter.2.6. Validation and ProductionmizuRoute was validated against discharge data from 27 USGS gage locations for 8 years spanning 2013–2021(U.S. Geological Survey, 2022). The Kling‐Gupta Efficiency (KGE, Gupta et al., 2009) was used as the objectivefunction on mean daily streamflow. This metric includes linear correlation, flow variability error, and bias. Thevalidation was performed on ice free months (May–September).RBM was validated against data from 18 USGS gages for the years 2018–2021 (U.S. Geological Survey, 2022)found in Table S1. 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2018 was used as the spin‐up period for the model. The RMSE wasused as the objective function, assessing daily temperature data for ice‐free months. The optimized parametervalues were compared to the baseline parameter values and the statistical model. A model outperformed anothermodel when it had a lower RMSE, which can occur based on different parameter sets used in the model validation.Table 1The Parameter Range of Model Parameters as Determined by U.S.Geological Survey Field Data of Alaskan Rivers From the National WaterInformation System (U.S. Geological Survey, 2022), Which Were Used inModel OptimizationVariableMinMaxMedianMeanα8.7716.5411.6811.79β6.3614.969.079.4μ−0.233.1−0.020.42γ0.170.480.380.33ad0.0452.420.110.19bd0.140.640.340.35aw2.2383.59.533.6bw0.050.540.210.23Minimum velocity (m/s)0.021.030.260.31Minimum depth (m)0.0311.580.210.60Minimum width (m)0.9167012.753.3Water Resources Research10.1029/2023WR036217BLASKEY ET AL.7 of 19 19447973, 2024, 4, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036217, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

At the three locations where the statistical and baseline models both out-performed the optimized model, the baseline model had better temperature simulations than the statistical modelat two. However, the benchmark statistical model outperformed the baseline model at half of the 18 gages. Thestatistical model performed well in the South and Central basins, excluding the Yukon River (RMSE of 6.33°C),but poorly in two of the three North basins (RMSE of 4.5°C).Monthly RMSE analysis demonstrates that the optimized river temperature model consistently outperforms thebaseline conditions and the statistical benchmark model throughout the ice‐free period (Figure 5). In the opti-mized model, the highest error occurred in May (2.81°C) and the lowest error in September (1.67°C). Rivers in theSouth region show greater variability in error across months, ranging from 1.06 to 2.19°C, respectively, while theNorth and Central regions display more consistency. The South performs better in spring and fall, with the highesterror occurring in July. The North and Central regions exhibit more varied performance, with the North per-forming best in August and worst in June, while the Central region shows the best performance in September andthe worst in May. Unlike the South, which has its lowest errors in May and September, the Central region only hasnotably lower error in September.Figure 4.

While this specific model system was employed in our study, anyregional or global model could serve as input to the river modeling system described here.This is the first regional application using CTSM as the land component in RASM (Cheng et al., 2023). CTSM'sdistinctive features, such as explicit representation of frozen soil dynamics, complex vegetation and canopyrepresentation, high resolution within the top 3 m of the soil layer, an adaptive time‐stepping method for improvedgroundwater flow simulation, and a multi‐layer snow model, contribute to a robust accounting of runoff gen-eration in permafrost zones (Lawrence et al., 2019). Moreover, CTSM now includes a representative hillslopehydrology capability, enabling parameterization of slope and aspect impacts on lateral water transfer, incidentradiation, and subsequent hydrological effects (Fan et al., 2019; Swenson et al., 2019). CTSM allows for ocean,lakes, glaciers, and mixed‐use pixels correcting radiative effects over large bodies of water and ice, but neglectsrivers, which is an adequate assumption at 4 km grid spacing. The land cover type was assumed to be static overthe study period.2.1.2. mizuRoutemizuRoute is a stand‐alone, vector‐based, river routing model that calculates streamflow at each river segment. Itemploys a gamma‐distribution‐based unit hydrograph to simulate hillslope routing within a catchment and uti-lizes the impulse response unit hydrograph based on the Lohmann 1D diffusive wave approximation for riverchannel routing. mizuRoute requires two parameters for the impulse response function: wave velocity anddiffusivity, but these have minimal impact on model performance (Mizukami et al., 2017). Total (gridded) runoffgenerated by CTSM is used as the only model input (Figure 1). Gridded input data were mapped to river segmentsusing a weighted average of the watershed intersection with each grid cell. River channel information is obtainedfrom MERIT Hydro (Yamazaki et al., 2019), which is described in Section 2.3.2.1.3. The River Basin ModelThe RBM is a physically based, one‐dimensional, stream temperature model that was designed to operate on agrid (Yearsley, 2012), but has been modified in this study to operate on vectorized river segments. It solves theheat advection equation using a semi‐Lagrangian approach (Yearsley, 2009, 2012). Water temperature issimulated by tracking water parcels through segments of the channel network then calculating the air‐surface heatexchange and the heat advected from lateral inflows (Yearsley, 2009, 2012). At a given river segment, surfacewater and groundwater inputs are assumed to be at the same temperature and hyporheic exchange is neglected.RBM requires meteorological forcing data (air temperature, shortwave and longwave radiation, vapor pressure,atmospheric pressure, and wind velocity) at daily timesteps, which were obtained from RASM (Figure 1). Theradiation terms account for topographic shading but do not consider vegetation shading at ground level. Vaporpressure deficit was output from RASM, so vapor pressure was calculated using the Clausius‐Clapeyron relation(Clausius, 1850). The same procedure to map gridded data to vectors for mizuRoute was used in RBM. Mete-orological variables were not adjusted for above stream conditions and could be a source of error within the model(Benyahya et al., 2010; Guenther et al., 2012; Leach & Moore, 2010). Vectorized river discharge output bymizuRoute was also used as an input to RBM. Additionally, the model requires boundary conditions at upstreamboundaries and river channel geometry at each segment as determined through parameterization and described inSection 2.2. Since the model does not calculate river ice, a minimum water temperature was set to 0.1°C in themodel.2.1.4. Statistical ModelA commonly applied statistical model, which calculates river temperature using a non‐linear equation that relatesair temperature at the gage location to river temperature, was used as a benchmarking intercomparison to thephysically based RBM. Model benchmarking is a technique widely used in land surface modeling. This techniqueuses a simplified model that has more flexibility to reproduce observed behavior to set performance expectationsfor more complex models before simulations are performed (Best et al., 2015; Newman et al., 2017). The non‐linear statistical model proposed by Mohseni et al. (1998) is a computationally frugal way to simulate watertemperature (Mantua et al., 2010; van Vliet et al., 2011). This statistical relationship is also the headwaterboundary condition with RBM, and it is described in more detail in Section 2.2 (Yearsley, 2012). This statisticalmodel is simplistic so it represents a minimum benchmark the physical model must achieve.

Both models used the same input air temperature. However, a universal parameter set wasfound to perform better in the statistical model than the regionalized parameters, so universal parameters wereused.2.2. Model ParametersRBM has two sets of model parameters: Leopold parameters, used to determine channel geometry and flowvelocity at every river segment, and Mohseni parameters used to determine river temperature at the headwaters(the most upstream river segments within the model), a boundary condition for the model.Results from using Leopold parameters were compared to those using average river widths from the MERITHydro data set (Yamazaki et al., 2019), and Leopold parameters were found to improve the model performance ofdaily river temperatures. Additionally, the use of Leopold parameters outperformed the use of average riverwidths and discharge in Manning's equation (Manning et al., 1890) to calculate velocity and average water depth(results not shown). Leopold parameters come from a set of power law relationships used to relate discharge tochannel geometry (Equations 1 and 2) established by Leopold and Maddock (1953):d = adQbd(1)w = awQbw(2)where, d is the average river depth, w is the average river width, Q is the daily averaged instantaneous discharge,and ad, bd, aw, and bw represent the Leopold parameters that establish a statistical relationship between dischargeand river width (parameters subscripted with w) and average depth (parameters subscripted with d). The averagewater velocity for each segment is calculated using the continuity equation (Equation 3).u =Qd × w(3)When discharge is near 0 m3 s−1, the Leopold parameters can result in near zero river width, depth, and velocity,so minimum values of these parameters are set to ensure model stability (Cheng et al., 2020). Since these areprescribed limits, they were added to the optimization. The model utilizes a statistical relationship between airtemperature (Tair) and the water temperature (Thw) for the upstream boundary condition at the headwaters(Equation 4) (Mohseni et al., 1998; Yearsley, 2012).Thw = μ +α −μ1 + eγ(β−Tair)(4)where μ = lower bound of water temperature (°C) (i.e., as air temperature decreases, the water temperature willnot be able to decrease below the value set for μ), α = upper bound of water temperature (°C) (i.e., as air tem-perature increases, the water temperature will not be able to increase above the value set for α), γ = steepest slopeof the air‐water temperature relationship function, and β = air temperature (°C) where γ occurs.These collectively make up the Mohseni parameters. Therefore, a total of 11 parameters (four Leopold param-eters, three minimums, and four Mohseni parameters) were analyzed to determine their impact on overallperformance.van Vliet et al. (2012) added a lag effect to the temperature regression, because water temperatures often lag airtemperatures on daily time scales.Tsmooth = (1 −λ) Tair(t −1) + λTair(t)(5)where Tsmooth is the weighted average air temperature of the current (t) and previous (t −1) time step, and λ is thelag coefficient. When observational data are fitted with this equation, the lag parameter was found to be generallyconstant at 0.1 (van Vliet et al., 2012), so this parameter was not optimized.Water Resources Research10.1029/2023WR036217BLASKEY ET AL.5 of 19 19447973, 2024, 4, Downloaded from https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023WR036217, Wiley Online Library on [09/04/2024].

Accurate estimations of winter cover crop performance and biophysicaltraits including biomass and fractional vegetative groundcover support accurate assessment ofenvironmental benefits. We examined the comparability of measurements between ground-basedand spaceborne sensors as well as between processing levels (e.g., surface vs. top-of-atmospherereflectance) in estimating cover crop biophysical traits. This research examined the relationshipsbetween SPOT 5, Landsat 7, and WorldView-2 same-day paired satellite imagery and handheldmultispectral proximal sensors on two days during the 2012–2013 winter cover crop season. Wecompared two processing levels from three satellites with spatially aggregated proximal data for redand green spectral bands as well as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We thencompared NDVI estimated fractional green cover to in-situ photographs, and we derived cover cropbiomass estimates from NDVI using existing calibration equations. We used slope and interceptcontrasts to test whether estimates of biomass and fractional green cover differed statistically betweensensors and processing levels. Compared to top-of-atmosphere imagery, surface reflectance imagerywere more closely correlated with proximal sensors, with intercepts closer to zero, regression slopesnearer to the 1:1 line, and less variance between measured values. Additionally, surface reflectanceNDVI derived from satellites showed strong agreement with passive handheld multispectral proximalsensor-sensor estimated fractional green cover and biomass (adj. R2 = 0.96 and 0.95; RMSE = 4.76%and 259 kg ha−1, respectively). Although active handheld multispectral proximal sensor-sensorderived fractional green cover and biomass estimates showed high accuracies (R2 = 0.96 and 0.96,respectively), they also demonstrated large intercept offsets (−25.5 and 4.51, respectively). Our resultssuggest that many passive multispectral remote sensing platforms may be used interchangeablyto assess cover crop biophysical traits whereas SPOT 5 required an adjustment in NDVI intercept.Active sensors may require separate calibrations or intercept correction prior to combination withpassive sensor data. Although surface reflectance products were highly correlated with proximalsensors, the standardized cloud mask failed to completely capture cloud shadows in Landsat 7, whichdampened the signal of NIR and red bands in shadowed pixels.Keywords: proximal sensors; satellite imagery; cover crops; biophysical traits; surface reflectance;biomass; fractional green cover; NDVISensors 2024, 24, 2339. https://doi.org/10.3390/s24072339https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors```"
sensors-24-02339.pdf,"media/sensors-24-02339.pdf:```Sensors 2024, 24, 233910 of 25To assess cover crop biophysical traits we used NDVI [66], which is defined as:NDVI = (NIR −Red)/(NIR + Red)(2)in combination with existing calibration equations for fractional green cover and biomass [18],which have been shown to be highly correlated with winter cover crop biophysical traits priorto index saturation [17–19]. Index saturation occurs as red reflectance has little variance inmoderate to high biomass plants while NIR reflectance increases in higher biomass plantscreating small or no increase in NDVI with increased biomass beyond saturation [67,68].The saturation point may vary across active and passive sensors as reflectance values canvary with different light sources [38]. For each of the five sensors, we calculated fractionalgreen vegetation cover and biomass using the following equations:fractional green cover = −21.904 + 116.305 × NDVI(3)ln(biomass) = 3.2022 + 5.3740 × NDVI(4)which were developed for cereal cover crop samples with Landsat 5, Landsat 7, Landsat8, and Harmonized Sentinel-2 SR NDVI imagery [18]. While indices improving on NDVIhave been proposed, many of these indices are based on the same fundamental visible toNIR relationship as NDVI [67,69,70] and comparison of 9 multi-spectral indices showedNDVI to be a top performer [17,21].2.3. Growing Degree DaysGrowing degree days (GDD) predict the timing of phenological milestones in plants [65].The base temperature is set to a point where plants are unable to grow (Tbase), which variesbased on species. GDD were calculated using the formula:GDD = [Tmax + Tmin)/2] −Tbase(5)where Tmax and Tmin are daily maximum and minimum temperatures, and Tbase is 4◦Celsius, a common base value for the winter cereal species included in this study [65].Daily minimum and maximum were obtained from the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information Daily SummariesStation located at Beltsville, MD, USA [66]. Daily mean temperatures below Tbase were setto Tbase, and then base temperature was subtracted from this value.The temperature during the sampling period was slightly above the climate normals(10-year average) for the area (Figure 4). GDD accumulation from 15 November indicatesthe relative warmth of the cover crop growing season (Figure 4, light gray). There was nosnow on the ground during either sampling date. In the 48 days between the samplingdates mild freezing occurred, and a total of 70 GDD were accumulated (Figure 4, darkgray). Importantly, <20 GDD accumulated and one freezing event occurred between the6 December 2012, sensor collection and the 14 December 2012 biomass sampling. Therewere also <20 GDD accumulated between the 10 January 2013, biomass sampling and 23January 2013, sensor collection.2.4. Statistical Analysis for Sensor IntercomparisonWe used simple linear regression models for sensor-to-sensor comparison of red, NIR,and NDVI values as well as for NDVI-calibrated fractional green vegetation cover and biomasscomparisons (Equations (2) and (3)) using the R Software Program v2023.09.1+494 [71]. Foreach model we compared goodness of fit and error using the coefficient of determination(adj. R2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). To compare how estimates of cover cropbiophysical traits varied between sensors, we used slope and intercept contrasts in the“emmeans” package [72].```"
sensors-24-02339.pdf,"media/sensors-24-02339.pdf:```Sensors 2024, 24, 233911 of 25To better compare NDVI values among sensors, we used passive handheld sensormeasurements as the “gold standard” as it is a self-calibrating proximal, sensor withupward and downward facing sensors that account for incoming and reflected radiationand can be used in partially cloudy conditions [44,65]. We compared the absolute value ofdifferences between reflectance values of each sensor and the CROPSCAN measurementsusing the following equation:differenced NDVI = |(Sensor NDVI −CROPSCAN NDVI)|(6)This reduces the dimensionality of the dataset that is present due to large biomass andNDVI variability among fields. Finally, we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to test forstatistical differences among these absolute value NDVI estimates. We employed Tukey’spost-hoc test to determine which sensors had statistically different NDVI values using a95% confidence (p < 0.05).3. ResultsThis study analyzed the comparability of red and NIR band and NDVI values amongseveral remote sensing measurements taken on the same day at similar times (Table 1).On both 6 December 2012 and 23 January 2023, mid-day Crop Circle, CROPSCAN, RGBphotos, and Landsat 7 data were collected (Table 1). Additionally, 6 December 2012 featuredWorldView-2 data and 23 January 2013 featured SPOT 5 data.3.1. Reflectance Comparisons of Satellite and Proximal SensorsWe compared satellite SR data to passive proximal sensor data CROPSCAN for twobands (red and near infrared) that had similar bandwidths across all sensors. Correla-tion between satellites and CROPSCAN red reflectance resulted in high accuracies (adj.R2 ≥0.89 for all satellites) for both December and January samplings (Table 2). Withinthese comparisons, we observed that satellite red bands overpredicted red reflectance ofCROPSCAN (slopes ranged from 1.08 to 1.187). Similarly, red reflectance between satelliteswas highly correlated, with goodness of fit values between Landsat 7 and WorldView-2and Landsat 7 and SPOT 5 of 0.96 for both dates (Table 2).Table 2.

R2 = 0.94 for Landsat 7; adj. R2 = 0.95 for Worldview)for SR imagery on 6 December (Table 2). However, these relationships were weaker betweenCROPSCAN and Landsat 7 on 23 January (adj. R2 = 0.79) as several points (n = 17) wereeliminated in the Landsat 7 analysis due to cloud shadows, reducing the overall numberof sampling points available for comparison, in addition to the possibility that cloudshadow effects may have been present in non-eliminated points. As with the red bands,satellite NIR reflectance values were highly correlated to each other, with goodness of fitvalues between Landsat 7 and WorldView-2 of 0.97 in December and goodness of fit valuesbetween Landsat 7 and SPOT 5 in January of 0.98 (Table 2). When sampling points undercloud shadows were not eliminated from analysis, relationships between Landsat 7 SR andCROPSCAN degraded considerably, with goodness of fit (R2) falling from 0.90 to 0.86 forred bands and 0.94 to 0.21 for NIR bands.Additionally, satellite TOAR and SR band and NDVI values were measured against oneanother and against proximal sensors (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 5). Landsat 7 and WorldView-2NDVI had very high goodness of fit with CROPSCAN, 0.95 and 0.99, respectively (Table 2,Figure 5). In both cases the slope of the line deviated only slightly, and the y-intercept wasclose to zero. The relationship between Landsat 7 and WorldView-2 NDVI values werehighly correlated with an adjusted R2 of 0.97 and slope and intercept near 1:1 (Table 2).Crop Circle was also highly correlated with satellite reflectance values (R2 of 0.90 to 0.94)but showed consistently low-biased reflectance values as seen invariable slopes and thelarge-magnitude intercept values (Table 2, Figure 5). Passive measurements of NDVI wereprone to saturation above 0.8 (Figure 5) while the active sensor (Crop Circle) NDVI valueswere more linear (Figure 5G).```"

Relation of Satellite Processing Level and Proximal SensorsWe also assessed how SR and TOAR corrections varied among satellites and thecoincident proximal sensor collections. Overall, we observed that satellite SR measurementswere more tightly clustered with CROPSCAN than with Crop Circle. Crop Circle NDVIhad the largest deviations in measurements, with values that were consistently below the1:1 line (Figures 5 and S1). We also observed higher SR NDVI compared to TOAR dueto increased reflectance in the NIR and decreased reflectance measurements in the redband (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 5). As with individual bands relationships in the visible andnear-infrared, R2 values for NDVI were identical between satellite TOAR and SR, but slopeand intercept values varied slightly with NDVI underpredicted in satellite TOAR (Table 3,Figure 5).ANOVA post-hoc tests were used to evaluate the calculated absolute value differencesin NDVI between CROPSCAN values (i.e., the “gold standard”) and the other sensors(Figure 6) collected on both sampling dates. The Landsat 7 TOAR from cloudy pointsshowed the greatest deviation from CROPSCAN and from other sensors (Figure 6). Simi-larly, Crop Circle showed one of the larger deviations from CROPSCAN NDVI and fromthe other sensors and processing levels. The difference in NDVI between CROPSCANand Crop Circle reduced as Crop Circle NDVI values increased, with average differencesabove NDVI = 0.8 of only 0.06. This may indicate delayed NDVI saturation of Crop Circlecompared to CROPSCAN. Landsat 7 SR Cloudy differenced NDVI also varied significantlyfrom non-cloudy Landsat 7 SR points.

Results from our comparisons of fractional green cover from SamplePoint andCROPSCAN were highly accurate with low error (adj. R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 5.52%; Figure S1,SF2). CROPSCAN also had the strongest relationship with in situ biomass of any sensorconsidered in this study (Figure S2 SF3). In this section, we only use SR and not TOARimagery as comparisons between SR and TOAR were made in the preceding section.Results from our fractional green cover models (Figure 7) demonstrated that all sen-sors produced high accuracies (adj. R2 = 0.95–0.99) and low errors (RMSE = 2.37–4.76%).All SR slopes slightly overpredicted fractional green cover (slopes = 1.09–1.42), whileCrop Circle slope underpredicted fractional green cover (slope = 0.87). We observed thatSPOT 5 SR had statistically lower intercepts than either Landsat 7 SR (T-ratio = −2.95,p = 0.02) and WorldView-2 SR (T-ratio = −4.29, p = 0.0002). Importantly, we observed thatCrop Circle intercepts were consistently much larger than any other sensor resulting inunderprediction of fractional green cover when using Equation (2) (T-ratios = 11.90–17.64,p < 0.0001) and implying that Crop Circle would require development of a separate cali-bration to successfully measure fractional green cover. There was also a deviation in theCrop Circle estimations above 70% also noted in the NDVI comparison above NDVI of0.75 (Figures 5G and 7). This may indicate that the passive sensors (CROPSCAN, Landsat,SPOT, WorldView) saturate at a lower NDVI value than the active sensor (Crop Circle).We also collected destructive biomass samples for a subset of sampled points (n = 36),which ranged from 75–4202 kg ha−1. Results from our comparisons of destructivelysampled biomass and CROPSCAN estimated biomass had a high accuracy (adj.

In practical terms, this indicates that avariety of passive multispectral satellites and proximal instruments provide comparablevalues, particularly for NDVI, which has important implications for quantifying andmapping winter cover crop biophysical traits. For instance, categorizing cover crops bythe amount of biomass or fractional green cover is useful on a landscape scale, wherehigh biomass accumulation provides greater water quality benefits compared to areaswith lower biomass accumulation [15]. The calibration equations (Equations (3) and (4))used to estimate cover crop biophysical traits from multispectral data were originallyderived from a combination of in situ biomass samples, fractional green cover samples, andpassive multispectral SR imagery from several moderate resolution satellites (Landsat 5,```"

Since WorldView-2 and SPOT5 sensors have comparable red and near infrared bandwidths with the moderate resolutionsatellites used to develop the calibration equations (Table 1), we tested our ability to extendthe application of the calibration equations to fine scale imagery from WorldView-2 andSPOT 5. Our results suggest that SR products from Landsat 7 and WorldView-2 couldlargely be used interchangeably to estimate cover crop biophysical traits, which couldbe useful in addressing spatiotemporal issues present in fine- to moderate-scale satelliteplatforms. Additionally, the newer WorldView-3 satellite features nearly identical redand NIR bands as WorldView-2 providing further WorldView-Landsat interoperability.However, although SPOT-5 imagery had similar accuracies, errors, and slopes to otherspaceborne sensors used in this study, its intercept was significantly lower. This indicatesthat as observed groundcover and biomass are lower SPOT-5 estimates would be biasedhigh (Figures 7 and 8).In comparing individual bands, we found increased NIR reflectance measurementsin SR compared to TOAR (average reflectance difference 0.018 SPOT, 0.015 Landsat,0.259 WorldView-2). Red reflectance measurements were smaller for SPOT SR (average−0.015) and Landsat SR (−0.012) and slightly larger in WV SR (0.040) compared to TOAR.The combination of shifts in these bands led to higher NDVI measurements calculatedfrom SR (average difference 0.041 SPOT, 0.034 Landsat, 0.025 WV) compared to TOAR, ashift typical in atmospheric corrections over vegetated areas [73] (Figure 5). These NDVIdifferences demonstrate that even for images with minimal haze/high visibility, atmo-spheric correction is critical for achieving accurate surface reflectance retrievals. The largestdifferences in band reflectance values was seen in Crop Circle, potentially as the activesensor can have band value differences that occur when the distance of the sensor changesrelative to the target (cover crop) and was designed for NDVI measurements rather thansingle band values [35]. A correction would need to be applied to compare band reflectancevalues directly between Crop Circle and the passive sensors included in this study [35].Although we observed very strong relationships between SR NDVI and derivedbiophysical traits and CROPSCAN, we noted several important differences between theactive sensor (Crop Circle) and all of the passive sensors. Crop Circle NDVI values wereconsistently lower than any passive sensor regardless of processing level (Figure 5) whichis similar to results found in previous comparisons of passive and active proximal sensorNDVI [35–37]. This may be due to a longer wavelength red band center in Crop Circle(670 nm) than the passive sensors (645–660 nm) which is the start of the red-edge portionof the electromagnetic spectrum (670–737 nm), an area noted for being more sensitive toplant quantity and health than the visible red (650–670 nm) [74,75]. The lower NDVI valuesin Crop Circle led to consistent under-predictions of cover crop fractional green cover(Figure 7) and biomass (Figure 8) using Equations (3) and (4), respectively. These resultsindicate that the existing equations for deriving cover crop biophysical traits from NDVIare not appropriate for Crop Circle without an intercept correction. Existing equationsfor deriving cover crop biophysical traits from NDVI draw from passive sensor datawith slightly different band centers and are not appropriate for Crop Circle without anintercept correction [16–18,76]. Additionally, active remote sensing signals can be affectedby collection rate, plant canopy characteristics, distance from the plant canopy, and devicetemperature [35,63]. The low NDVI values returned from Crop Circle are likely due tolower NIR signal returns compared with sunlight for the passive sensors. as seen in thelarge NIR slope difference between CROPSCAN and Crop Circle in Table 2. Crop Circlemay be appropriate for isolated analysis as it is shown to have consistent relationshipswith fractional cover and biomass [35], but in this study did not have comparable SRmeasurements to passive proximal and space-based sensors. Therefore, these resultssuggest that new calibration equations would be needed for deriving fractional green coverand biomass from active spectral sensors such as Crop Circle, or, alternatively, estimating arobust intercept offset term.```"

IntroductionWinter cover crops have proven to be an effective method to reduce sedimentationand nutrient runoff into waterways, and increase environmental benefits including im-proved soil health and water quality [1,2]. As they accumulate biomass, winter cover cropssequester residual soil nutrients, and also prevent wind and water erosion of soils by pro-viding vegetative groundcover [3,4]. They also have climate mitigation potential throughcarbon sequestration [5,6] and greenhouse gas reduction for non-leguminous species [7]. Inecologically sensitive estuaries such as the Chesapeake Bay, cover crop-mediated reductionsin nitrate losses and sediment from agricultural areas have led to reduced risk of algalblooms, eutrophication, and threats to wildlife [2,8,9].The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has identified winter cover crops asan effective practice to reduce agricultural pollutants and meet total maximum daily loadtargets (the amount of pollutant that a water body can safely assimilate) in the ChesapeakeBay [10]. Cover crop adoption in the Chesapeake Bay watershed is incentivized throughnational programs such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural ResourcesConservation Service (NRCS) Environmental Quality Incentives Program [11] and throughstate-led initiatives such as the Maryland Department of Agriculture’s Maryland WaterQuality Cost-Share Program [12]. Although cost-share payment amounts and enrollmentvary each year, Maryland had a record of 561,344 acres of cover crops covering 64% ofcropland planted in 2016 [1] and leads the nation in overall cover crop adoption [2,13].Multispectral remote sensing has been demonstrably successful as a tool to monitorwinter cover crop growth and biophysical traits such as biomass and groundcover [14–21]from both proximal (in-field or handheld) [17,21,22] and spaceborne platforms [16,18–21].Satellite data are often publicly accessible, but there are tradeoffs between their temporaland spatial resolution. For example, in Talbot County, Maryland, fields average 20 hectarescompared with 65 hectares in the Midwest [23]. This smaller size disallows use of coarse-resolution satellites with high temporal resolution such as the Moderate Resolution ImagingSpectroradiometer (MODIS; 250 m) that acquire imagery daily. Satellite imagery with fineto moderate spatial resolution (2 m to 30 m pixel size) are more appropriate for measuringsmall fields typical in the Chesapeake Bay watershed but are still subject to issues relatedto mixed pixels, particularly in fall and winter when cover crop canopies are not fullyclosed and soil and crop residues are present. Many of these platforms such as Landsat7 (30 m), Sentinel-2 (10–30 m), Satellite pour l’Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT 5; 10 m),and WorldView-2 (2–5 m) are passive sensors that can only collect accurate data overareas free of clouds and cloud shadows [24,25]. Because of these limitations, passivesatellite platforms may experience large data gaps due to return frequency, cloud cover, andsnow presence, particularly during the winter cover crop season (October through May).These spatiotemporal shortcomings in fine-to-moderate scale imagery may be overcome ifintegrated with each other and proximal instrumentation.Proximal reflectance sensors operate at a short distance from the ground (0.1–5 m) andcan be used to quantify biophysical traits and their in-field variation at very fine spatialscales (~2 cm) [26–29]. These sensors can be handheld, pole mounted, or mounted ontractors [17,21,26–30]. Proximal sensors record reflectance measurements with minimalinterference from the atmosphere, theoretically providing accuracy assessment comparisonswith atmospherically corrected satellite imagery.Both satellite and proximal sensors can be passive, collecting reflected sunlight, oractive, emitting light and collecting the reflectance of the emitted light. Passive sensorsare designed to be collected near solar noon at a similar time of day for each successivecollection. Since active sensors emit their own light, they can be operated in varied lightconditions and handheld proximal active sensors can be operated under cloudy conditions.Active sensors also use more operational energy and are more common in proximal orairborne platforms than satellite platforms. Although several studies compare the inter-changeability of passive satellite sensors [31–33], the ability to estimate biophysical traitsusing proximal active and passive sensors [34–38], satellite passive and uncrewed aerial```"

While all cloudmasking routines are prone to some error [25], improvements to cloud masks are expectedfor updated Collection-2 processing of Landsat 8/9 imagery [77] in addition to improvedgeometric and atmospheric correction [78] compared to Collection-2 Landsat 7 imageryused in this study. Sentinel-2, a moderate resolution spaceborne satellite, is prone to similarcloud mask errors as seen here, although errors are reduced when using the HarmonizedLandsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) data product with improved cloud masking and atmosphericcorrection [79].The observed red and NIR band differences in sampling points under cloud shadowscan be explained due to differences in atmospheric scattering at various wavelengths.Clouds block and absorb nearly all near-infrared light and there is minimal scattering fromthe atmosphere to the surface leading to low reflectance values. Accordingly, the coefficientof determination (R2) between Landsat 7 and SPOT 5 fell from 0.98 to 0.15 for NIR bandsfrom the shadowed pixels. In the shorter green and red wavelengths, increased atmosphericscattering, both from the haze in the atmosphere and diffuse radiation from the surface,can result in a fairly strong signal as scattered light fills in shadowed areas [24], explainingthe lesser degree of degradation of the red shadowed reflectance (0.96 to 0.85) relative tothe NIR shadowed reflectance. This is in accordance with research by Simpson and Sitt [80]demonstrating that cloud shadows exert a greater influence on near-infrared bands thanvisible bands. Although the effect is less pronounced in the relationship between Landsat 7SR and CROPSCAN NDVI with goodness of fit (R2) falling from 0.95 to 0.92 and averageabsolute difference in NDVI increasing by 0.03, the effect is amplified when estimatingbiomass (RMSE increased from 259 kg ha−1 to 426 kg ha−1) or fractional cover (RMSEincreased from 4.8 to 6.4%) derived from NDVI. If we only examine the sampling pointsunder cloud shadows the RMSE of estimated biomass is 758 kg ha−1 and the RMSE offractional cover is 9.8%. This emphasizes the potential impact of cloud mask errors whencloud shadows are not detected.When satellite imagery was converted to SR and compared with proximal data, inter-cepts were closer to zero and slopes were closer to the 1:1 line than when TOAR imagerywas used (Tables 2 and 3). The exceptions were sampling points covered by cloud shadowas in the 23 January Landsat 7 image. When these points were included in the analysis,near infrared measurements showed a poor relationship between satellite and proximalsensors and between both satellite images. When the cloud shadow points were removed,correlations increased between Landsat 7 and passive proximal sensor readings from R2 of0.91 to 0.95. These findings highlight the need for both atmospheric corrections along withhigh quality cloud and cloud shadow detection. NDVI between satellites and proximalsensors also exhibited high goodness of fit among sensors on both dates (Figures 5 and 6).For the 23 January Landsat 7 imagery, conversion from TOAR to SR followed by calculationof NDVI resulted in a better match between satellite and proximal sensors. Althoughconversion to SR reduced some of the effects of cloud shadows on Landsat 7 NDVI, theeffects were amplified in estimates of biophysical characteristics with doubled and triplederror estimates (RMSE) for fractional cover biomass, respectively, in the cloud shadowpixels compared to estimates from CROPSCAN. The impacts of cloud shadow were clearlydemonstrated in this study. Further study of these impacts could focus on updates tocloud masking procedures comparing Collection-1 vs. Collection-2 processing for indi-vidual Landsat 7 sensors, and comparison of cloud masking procedures for Landsat 7compared to Landsat 8 and 9 with different routines for cloud masking and atmosphericcorrection [48,78]. The inclusion of a cirrus band on Landsat 8–9 instruments has beendemonstrated as beneficial for improving the accuracy of cloud screening [78,81] as hassubpixel shift detection for sensors that lack thermal bands such as Sentinel-2 [82].```"
sensors-24-02339.pdf,"media/sensors-24-02339.pdf:```Sensors 2024, 24, 233921 of 25Atmospheric correction of TOAR satellite data to SR resulted in reflectance valuesthat were closer to proximal SR than were TOAR data. This is important for categorizingcover crops and estimating biophysical traits based on their NDVI values. There wasa high goodness of fit between percent vegetative groundcover and NDVI values forall proximal sensor and satellite measurements. Although the conversion to SR did notimprove correlation to fractional cover for individual dates, the higher consistency for NDVIfor SR processing is needed for time series applications. Conversion to SR is importantwhen comparing across satellite sensors, particularly for commercial image sources likeSPOT 5 and WorldView-2 that are often delivered in TOAR format.Data in this study were collected under relatively clear sky conditions to ensure thatadequate irradiance reached the sensors. To acquire clear satellite imagery and be able tocapture ground conditions with proximal sensors, mostly clear conditions are necessary.SR data comparisons from satellites might be more important under conditions of lowatmospheric visibility where there is increased atmospheric interference and calibrationto ground-based sensors is more challenging. NDVI in particular is impacted by aerosoleffects if they are not properly accounted for through atmospheric correction [83]; which canbe explained by enhanced scattering at red wavelengths negatively biasing NDVI values.Similarly, water vapor and thin cloud formations also negatively bias NDVI if unaccountedfor by atmospheric correction as these constituents enhance absorption at near infraredwavelengths [84]; in turn reducing near infrared reflectance and NDVI. Assessment ofsensor performance under low visibility conditions could improve our understanding ofdata usability with these atmospheric conditions.Importantly, our findings suggest that SR products calculated from multispectralsatellite sensors and on-the-go proximal sensors are highly correlated with each other andcan be used interchangeably when assessing cover crop biomass and fractional groundcover.The various sensors produced high accuracy predictions of cover crop traits under clear-skyconditions and performed similarly. However, an NDVI intercept correction specific toactive on-the-go proximal sensors could enable characterization of biophysical traits andeliminate the need for clear sky conditions.5. ConclusionsThe results of this study demonstrate that SPOT-5, Landsat-7, Worldview-2, and CROP-SCAN sensors were highly correlated with each other for both visible and near-infraredbands. CROPSCAN had high goodness of fit with cover crop biomass and groundcover(adj. R2 = 0.80 and 0.96; 56 kg ha−1 and RMSE = 5.52%, respectively). SR data were con-sistently closer to a 1:1 relationship with CROPSCAN than TOAR and were successfullyused to estimate cover crop biomass (adj. R2 = 0.95–0.99, RMSE = 114.4–351.4 kg ha−1)and groundcover (adj. R2 = 0.95–0.99, RMSE = 2.37%–4.76%). The ability to adapt biomassand groundcover estimates across different platforms enables us to understand cover cropperformance over larger areas and better link cover crop performance to environmentaloutcomes [2]. This has important implications for current efforts to map cover crop imple-mentation and performance using imagery from multispectral satellite platforms. Datafrom passive and active proximal sensors can be collected as needed by farmers in clearor cloudy conditions and combined with satellite imagery to provide a more completetemporal understanding of cover crop growth and performance. This integration can aid inovercoming lingering issues of clouds and cloud shadows limiting the availability of datain the winter and spring or failing to be masked and negatively impacting data quality.Supplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/s24072339/s1, Figure S1.

Additionally, most sensor intercomparisonstudies focus on summer crops with higher biomass conditions rather than detecting greenbiomass under the low biomass conditions associated with monitoring cover crop perfor-mance. Exploring the relationship between high-spatial resolution handheld sensor dataand satellite-based measurements can allow for scaling up of difficult-to-acquire proximaldata, resulting in greater operational efficiency when assessing the environmental benefitsof cover crop implementation.In this study we sought to: (1) quantify variation between and among three pas-sive satellites (Landsat 7, WorldView-2, and SPOT 5) with two processing levels (surfacereflectance [SR] and top-of-atmosphere reflectance [TOAR]) and coincident handheld prox-imal sensors (one passive and one active) red and near infrared (NIR) band reflectance andnormalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, and (2) quantify variation in sensor-derived estimates of cover crop biophysical traits (biomass and fractional groundcover)attributed to the various sensors. Although previous studies have explored the relationshipbetween satellite reflectance measurements and SR measurements from stationary ground-based instruments, this research compares ground-based “on-the-go” proximal sensor datawith fine and moderate resolution satellite imagery that have been corrected to both TOARand SR. The TOAR and SR processing levels, in addition to SR processing tools, have beenshown to exhibit differences in band reflectance and NDVI values [42,43]. Thus, TOAR vs.SR comparisons are also a key focus of this research effort. This research has the potentialto evaluate the interchangeability of commonly used satellite and proximal sensor NDVIwith widely available processing levels for estimating cover crop biophysical traits.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Study Site and DesignAll data were collected on fields located at the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS)—Beltsville Agricultural Research Center (BARC)in Beltsville, Maryland, USA during the winter of 2012–2013. Cover cropped fields sampledin this study (n = 5) included two barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) fields, one ryegrass (Loliummultiflorum Lam.) field, one triticale (Triticale hexaploide Lart.) field, and one wheat (Triticumestivum L.) field, all of which are commonly planted cover crop species in the Mid-Atlanticregion (Figure 1). Planting dates and management methods are described in Prabhakaraet al. [17].Within each field we collected satellite, handheld sensor, and biophysical data includ-ing biomass, fractional groundcover, carbon concentration, and nitrogen concentration. Weused a combination of data from three passive multispectral satellites (Landsat 7, SPOT 5,and WorldView-2) with different pixel sizes and resampled the pixel size to the largest ofthe three, 30 m × 30 m. Field sampling occurred on two dates: 6 December 2012, and 23 Jan-uary 2013 (Figure 2). On the same dates and at overlapping times near midday we collectedproximal sensor data from an active sensor, Crop Circle, and a passive sensor, CROPSCANin tracks that passed through the interior of each sampled Landsat pixel [44,45]. Addition-ally, one in situ biomass sample (0.5 m2) and three nadir RGB photos were collected nearthe centroid of each Landsat pixel (Figure 2).```"

Atmospheric visibility wascalculated with a log-linear interpolation of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) at 500 nm and667 nm to derive AOT at 550 nm which was used to estimate visibility. Both days werevery clear, but 6 December 2012 (300 km visibility) more so than 23 January 2013 (157 kmvisibility) [46]. On 23 January, there were popcorn clouds scattered throughout the image(Figure 3), whereas no clouds or shadows were present on 6 December.

These areas were not detected using the cloud shadow and clouds maskthat were included with the Landsat 7 Level-1 or the Landsat 7 Level-2 data products. The dark andlight blue areas indicated in the legend are cloud and cloud shadows that were present in the Landsat7 mask products.2.2.1. Landsat 7Atmospherically corrected Landsat 7 SR and TOAR scenes from 6 December 2012and 23 January 2013 (path 15/row 33) were downloaded from the U.S. Geological Survey(USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center Science Processing Archi-tecture [47] in 2013. Landsat 7 imagery were processed to SR with the Landsat EcosystemDisturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) algorithm [48]. This processing oc-curred prior to downloading from Earth Explorer [49]. Although Landsat 7 had scan lineerrors over a significant portion at the edges of its swath, our sampling locations wereunaffected by this issue because they fell in the center of the swath [50].Cloud masking of Landsat was achieved by applying the F mask band of Collection2 [24]. The F mask identifies potentially cloud-, water-, snow-, or ice-covered pixels basedon their spectral and thermal properties and pairs clouds with cloud shadows usingobject-based matching; these pixels are identified in the F mask band and can be removedfrom analyses [45]. The 23 January Landsat 7 image contained cloud shadows covering17 sampling points within the triticale and the first barley fields that were not detectedby the cloud mask (Figure 3). Cloud shadows over the study sites were only presentin the Landsat 7 image due to differences in imaging times (the Landsat 7 image wasacquired at 15:52:38 GMT and the SPOT 5 image at 16:05:22 GMT). Cloud shadows aretypically removed as “contaminated” pixels that are not useful for derivation of surfacecharacteristics [51]. Because the cloud shadows affected reflectance, statistical models usingLandsat 7 imagery were calculated with the shadowed sampling points removed (n = 17).Cloud shadowed Landsat 7 pixels were removed from the Landsat 7 comparisons but weremaintained in all other sensors.2.2.2. SPOT 5 and WorldView-2A SPOT 5 image for BARC (path 622/row 271) was tasked as part of the USGSNorth American Data Buy, acquired on 23 January 2013, and downloaded from USGSEarth Explorer [49]. SPOT 5 features a 10-m spatial resolution and four bands (Figure 3).WorldView-2 imagery was acquired on 6 December 2012 (Imagery copyright 2012 Maxar,https://maxar.com/maxar-intelligence/products/satellite-imagery [accessed on 8 July2023], Westminster, CO, USA). The WorldView-2 sensor has 8 spectral bands (Figure 3)with a 2-m spatial resolution for visible and NIR bands. The raw SPOT 5 and WorldView-2images were manually georegistered using a linear pixel shift to match a field boundarypolygon vector shapefile and ensure proper alignment by visual inspection in ENVI version4.8 [52]. TOAR was calculated in ENVI using image metadata. SPOT 5 and WorldView-2imagery were converted to SR using MODTRAN 5.3.3. radiative transfer code [53,54].MODTRAN has generally been found to closely intercompare with other atmosphericcorrection tools including FLAASH and Sen2Cor [43,55] as well as 6S [56,57].MODTRAN parametrization (input) data required for atmospheric correction includeinformation about various aerosols (i.e., AOT at 550 nm [AOT550]), water vapor (totalcolumn values in cm), and ozone (total column values in Dobson units). AOT550 andwater vapor values were derived from AERONET data from the Goddard Space FlightCenter site [46]. Total ozone data were estimated using Environment Canada daily ozonemaps [58].

To allow for a more precise comparison against other sensors, theSPOT 5 and WorldView-2 imagery were smoothed using a low pass filter and a 3 × 3 (SPOT5) and 15 × 15 (WorldView-2) kernel to more closely match Landsat 7’s spatial resolution.2.2.3. CROPSCANThe CROPSCAN MSR16R handheld passive multispectral radiometer [44] used in thisstudy was able to record “on-the-go” measurements every 3 s as it crossed the landscape byderiving geographic coordinates associated with each reflectance data point from a TrimbleGeoXH (Westminster, CO, USA) GPS unit with sub-meter accuracy. CROPSCAN has agreater spectral resolution than either Landsat 7 or SPOT 5, gathering data across 16 spectralbands that are centered on the visible-near infrared (VNIR) portion of the electromagneticspectrum. The CROPSCAN instrument was mounted on a hand-held pole with nadir viewangle, approximately 1.8 m above the vegetation canopy, creating a 1 m2 field of view. Theinstrument employs a two-way sensor system that measures incident (downwelling) solarirradiance and upwelling radiance from the ground, enabling self-calibration to SR. Whenillumination conditions are not optimal due to cloudy conditions or low sun angles, lack ofradiation reaching the sensor can result in inaccurate SR measurements. Therefore, all datawith downwelling irradiance values below 300 W m-22 were excluded from analysis. Allcollections occurred under clear sky conditions between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. solar standardtime to avoid signal:noise reductions associated with low sun angles [60]. CROPSCANcollections (n = 2740, average 39 scans per sample; Table 1) were averaged within eachLandsat 7 pixel (buffered inward 5 m to reduce edge effects) to match spatial resolutionbetween the sensors.2.2.4. Crop CircleA Crop Circle ACS-430 active proximal sensor [45] was deployed in tandem withthe CROPSCAN to gather spectral data. The Crop Circle is an active sensor with itsown illumination source, and therefore has fewer sky-condition limitations than passiveradiometric sensors which require specific solar illumination conditions. However, activesensors can result in low-biased or high-biased reflectance readings when compared withpassive satellite sensors [35,61,62]. Active remote sensing signals can also be affected byplant canopy characteristics, distance from the plant canopy, and device temperature [35,63].The spectral resolution of the Crop Circle contains three bands in the red, red-edge, andNIR portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The sensor was held approximately 1 mabove the soil surface creating a 0.13 m2 field of view and collected approximately one scanper second, associated with a GPS coordinate. Crop Circle readings (n = 31,497; average450 scans per sample; Table 1) were collected and averaged within each buffered (−5 m)Landsat 7 pixel.2.2.5. RGB Photography and Destructive Biomass SamplesAt 23 of the 35 sensor sample locations, we collected three shoulder-height (1.5 m)red-green-blue (RGB) photographs using a Nikon D3100 DSLR camera (Minato City, Tokyo,Japan) repeated on two dates (14 December 2012, and 23 January 2013) between 10:00 a.m.and 2:00 p.m. solar standard time (Figures 1 and 2, Table 1). Photographs (n = 138;23 samples × 3 photos per sample × 2 dates) were processed using SamplePoint v1.60software [64] to quantify fractional green vegetation, chlorotic yellow vegetation, and cropresidue cover. A smaller number of photos were collected alongside the sensor collectionon 6 December 2012 (10 sampling locations, n = 30 photos).

To assess cover crop biophysical traits we used NDVI [66], which is defined as:  NDVI = (NIR − Red)/(NIR + Red) (2) in combination with existing calibration equations for fractional green cover and biomass [18], which have been shown to be highly correlated with winter cover crop biophysical traits prior to index saturation [17–19]. Index saturation occurs as red reflectance has little variance in moderate to high biomass plants while NIR reflectance increases in higher Figure 4.

An eruption buildup (July 1–23, 2019) consisting of increasing seismicity and surface temperature anomalies, presumably related to magma rising to a shallow level within the open-conduit system.2.	A cone-building eruption (July 24–September 19, 2019) with Strombolian activity that built a small spatter cone confined within the summit crater.3.	An eruption hiatus (September 19–October 13, 2019) after magma withdrawal and tephra cone collapse. 4.	A renewed eruption (October 13, 2019–January 3, 2020), which quickly built a large tephra cone that filled the summit crater and enabled lava flows to spill onto the northeast to northwest flanks, generating meltwater lahars. Occasional tephra cone collapse events generated ash clouds and small pyroclastic flows.5.	Ash-rich paroxysms (January 3–20, 2020) consisting of three distinct sequences that each started with Strom­bolian activity before intensifying to lava fountaining and lava flows. Each paroxysm preceded a days-long pause in eruption. The activity culminated in an ash-rich paroxysm on January 20 that produced clouds reaching altitudes of ~30,000 ft (~9,100 m) ASL and pyroclastic deposits on the upper flanks of the volcano. 6.	A second prolonged eruption hiatus (January 20–March 11, 2020) after the final ash-rich paroxysm on January 20. 7.	A final renewed eruption (March 11–31, 2020) that resulted in Strombolian cone-building confined to the summit crater.After phase 7 of the eruptive activity in March, minor unrest and occasional cone collapse events occurred into the summer, but magma was not seen at the surface. Phases 1–4 of the 2019–2020 eruption are described in the 2019 Alaska Volcano Observatory annual report (Orr and others, 2023), whereas this discussion covers phases 5–7, beginning with the eruptive activity in January.Ash-Rich Paroxysm Sequence (January 1–20)Eruptive activity at the start of 2020 followed a similar pattern to that established in November 2019: seismic tremor and lava flow activity generally increased over a period of several hours before abruptly shutting down in days-long pauses. Unlike activity in the prior weeks, however, three periods of escalating activity in January culminated in increased ash emissions, prompting AVO to issue a Volcanic Activity Notice (VAN) each time (fig. 6).EXPLANATIONEXPLANATIONVolcano Activity NoticeSO2 detectionUndersaturatedSaturatedDate10510610710901/07/202001/10/202001/13/202001/04/2020CVIIRS total radiative power, in watts10801/19/202001/22/202001/25/202001/28/202001/16/202001/31/2020250500750BRSAM (station SSBA), 12-hour average0AORANGEREDFigure 6.  Timeline of eruptive activity at Shishaldin Volcano, Alaska, in January 2020.

The frequent detection of infrasound signals suggested the occurrence of Strombolian explosive activity. Seismic tremor, already elevated, began increasing further on the morning of January 7, and starting around 16:00 UTC (7:00 AKST) that morning, a plume reaching an altitude of ~20,000 ft (~6,100 m) ASL was detected in satellite data. Strong mid-infrared satellite signatures accompanied the plume, suggesting ongoing lava effusion and vigorous lava fountaining, similar to the behavior seen on January 3. A VAN noting this increased activity was issued at 18:39 UTC (9:39 AKST), although the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were not changed. At ~20:00 UTC (~11:00 AKST), the seismic tremor started to decline, followed by the detection of volcanic lighting at 20:25 UTC (11:25 AKST). Satellite images acquired shortly afterward indicated that the plume had become more ash-rich and now reached an altitude as high as ~27,000 ft (~8,200 m) ASL (fig. 10A), although tremor remained low.

Image acquired by Sentinel-2, January 20, 2020 (22:18 coordinated universal time; 13:18 Alaska standard time).and a WorldView-3 satellite image from January 25 showed no visible eruptive activity. Some discreet seismic events and infrasound signals were detected occasionally later on, but these did not build to a clear eruptive signal like that which followed the eruption events earlier in January. On February 7 at 01:20 UTC (February 6 at 16:20 AKST), the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were lowered to YELLOW and ADVISORY. No other significant activity was detected at the volcano in February, and clear satellite images showed quiet conditions consisting of minor steaming at the vent and cooling lava flow deposits on the flanks. Final Renewed Eruption (March 11–31)After weeks of quiescence, eruptive activity resumed in March 2020, although it was contained within the summit crater. The first indication of renewed activity appeared in a WorldView-2 satellite image from March 11 that showed a small area of recent ash deposits near the summit crater (fig. 13A). The inside of the crater was mostly obscured by steam in the image, but it was generally similar to its appearance in other high-resolution satellite images from February. In the following days, mid-infrared satellite images began to show increased surface temperatures at the volcano (fig. 5). A WorldView-3 image from March 14 showed a saturated short-wave infrared signature at the summit, indicating that lava was erupting again within the summit crater (fig. 13B). In response, AVO increased the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to ORANGE and WATCH on March 15 at 6:31 UTC (22:31 AKDT on March 14).During the following few weeks, seismicity was elevated and small explosions (probably from Strombolian activity) were detected occasionally in infrasound data. Satellite radar images suggested renewed cone growth, although all eruptive activity was confined within the summit crater. Another WorldView-3 image from March 22 (fig. 13C) showed activity similar to that on March 14. Seismicity declined thereafter through the end of the month, and an April 1 satellite image showed only a steam plume and no evidence of a heat source, suggesting the eruption had ended. On April 2, a clear satellite image with an unobscured view into the summit crater confirmed that no eruptive activity was occurring (fig. 13D). Due to an absence of activity, AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to YELLOW and ADVISORY on April 16 at 19:44 UTC (11:44 AKDT). Aftermath (April 1–End of Year)Low-level unrest continued at Shishaldin Volcano for months after its 2019–2020 eruption. Elevated surface temperatures continued appearing in satellite images, and frequent satellite detections of SO2 were made in late April and May (fig. 5). These SO2 detections also coincided with the increasing ultraviolet radiation of long summer days, which raises the sensitivity of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), a satellite instrument used for these detections. Other remote sensing observations made during this period of low-level unrest indicated that magma was still stored shallowly within the conduit, enabling magma degassing, high temperatures, and minor collapse events within the summit crater.```"

The overall lava flow outlines are mapped on the basis of WorldView-2 images from January 14 (22:17 coordinated universal time [UTC]; 14:17 Alaska daylight time [AKDT]) and January 25, 2020 (22:12 UTC; 14:12 AKDT), that were 11º and 17º off nadir, respectively, reducing orthorectification distortion on the steep slopes of the volcano. The internal lava flow boundaries, as distinguished by dates, are approximate and are based on typically more distorted WorldView-1, -2, and -3 satellite images. Some lahar and pyroclastic flow deposits were difficult to distinguish in satellite images and may be gradational in character; thus, they were mapped as a single layer. The lahar deposits follow drainages and those on the north flank continue to the Bering Sea coast.flatter plains north of the volcano. The deposits suspected to be pyroclastic flows generally extended no more than 3 km from the summit vent, whereas lahars followed drainages and traveled farther, some reaching all the way to the coast (more than 30 km north of the summit). Because of the difficulty in distinguishing between pyroclastic and lahar deposits using satellite images alone, they are mapped as a single unit in figure 14. Only a few samples are available from the 2019–2020 eruption. Samples of a tephra deposit from a cone collapse event, collected by field crews on December 20, 2019, are described in Orr and others (2023). AVO field crews also sampled the toe of a lava flow on the northeast flank of the volcano in 2022; this sample is currently being studied. Community members in the City of Cold Bay collected ash from the paroxysm of January 7, 2020; others in False Pass collected ash from the early stage of the January 19 paroxysm (figs. 15, 16). Both of these samples were dominated by roughly equal parts (1) juvenile, highly fluidal and glassy sideromelane grains (fig. 15) and (2) partially devitrified tachylite grains (fig. 16) (classifications by Loewen and others, 2021). However, the samples also contained phenocrysts of plagioclase and olivine, along with microlites of plagioclase, olivine, and magnetite. The glass composition was basaltic and was similar to samples from the 1999 eruption (Stelling and others, 2002). ```"

The most notable volcanic activity in 2020 was an eruption of Shishaldin Volcano, which produced lava flows, lahars, and ash. Mount Cleveland had one small ash-producing eruption in June but was quiet thereafter. Other activity documented in 2020 consisted of elevated seismicity at the volcanoes Mount Veniaminof, Pavlof Volcano, Makushin Volcano, Atka volcanic complex (Korovin Volcano), Great Sitkin Volcano, and Semisopochnoi Island. Finally, the resuspension of ash deposited during the 1912 Novarupta-Katmai eruption was documented on three occasions. IntroductionThe Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) is a joint program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, and the State of Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys. AVO was formed in 1988 and uses Federal, State, and university resources to (1) monitor and study Alaska’s hazardous volcanoes (fig. 1) in order to assess the nature, timing, and likelihood of volcanic activity; (2) assess volcanic hazards associated with anticipated activity, including the kinds of events, their effects, and areas at risk; and (3) provide timely and accurate information on volcanic hazards, and warnings of impending dangerous activity, to officials (local, State, and Federal) and the public. This report summarizes notable unrest and other kinds of activity associated with volcanoes in Alaska during 2020 (tables 1, 2) and briefly describes AVO’s response. It contains information about all identified volcanic unrest, even if no formal public notification was issued at the time. 1 U.S. Geological Survey.2 Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys.3 University of Alaska Fairbanks.4 Seismological Laboratory, California Institute of Technology.Observations, images, and data that are typically not published elsewhere are included in this report. Similar summaries of volcanic unrest and AVO’s response have been published annually since 1992. Although AVO faced challenges in 2020 with regards to staff quarantined at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, appropriate safety precautions were implemented and AVO’s field season was ultimately a success.Table 1.  Summary of activity at Alaska volcanoes in 2020, including but not limited to confirmed eruptions, possible eruptions, increases in seismicity, observations of fumarolic activity, and other notable events.[Volcano locations shown in figure 1.

In 2020, Mount Cleveland had one confirmed explosion.The character of volcanic activity at Mount Cleveland in late 2019—low seismicity, occasional thermal anomalies, and a small summit steam plume (Orr and others, 2023)—carried over into 2020, and Mount Cleveland began the year at an Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level of YELLOW and ADVISORY (fig. 20). No changes within the summit crater were observed during the first several months of the year; elevated surface temperatures and a weak steam plume were observed sporadically during periods of clear weather. The low level of thermal activity was corroborated by high-resolution satellite imagery in April and May that showed a partly snow-covered dome, suggesting the surface was cold (fig. 21).Because of the apparent quiescence at Mount Cleveland, its Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were changed to UNASSIGNED on May 7 at 23:37 UTC (14:37 HADT). Three weeks later, on June 2 at 06:31 UTC (June 1 at 21:31 HADT), a small explosion triggered the infrasound alarm in Adak, Alaska (fig. 22), and was detected shortly thereafter on the infrasound array in the City of Dillingham, Alaska. A small ash cloud was observed shortly afterward in satellite imagery drifting southward at an altitude of ~22,000 ft (~6,700 m). This event was the first explosion detected at Mount Cleveland since January 2019—a span of 17 months and the longest repose period at the volcano since its onset of eruptive activity in 2001. In response, the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were elevated to ORANGE and WATCH on June 2 at 07:46 UTC (June 1 at 22:46 HADT) (fig. 20).

Located events ranged in magnitude from ML –1.2 to ML 3.5. The ML 3.5 event occurred on March 6 (at 15:31 UTC; 05:31 HAST) under the east rim of the summit crater at a depth of 0.2 km. This earthquake was the strongest event recorded beneath Great Sitkin Volcano since its period of unrest began in 2016 (fig. 29). For comparison, the largest earthquake recorded beneath the volcano’s edifice since monitoring began in 1999 was ML 4.3. That event took place on May 28, 2002, and was located beneath the southeast flank of the volcano (Pesicek and others, 2008).The other notable earthquake activity at Great Sitkin Volcano in 2020 consisted of a cluster of seven earthquakes that occurred between January 31 and February 1. These seven events ranged from ML −0.6 to 0.27 and had depths ranging from 22.6 to 27.0 km. AVO noted no major changes or unusual activity at the summit crater and dome during 2020, although the degree of visible steaming decreased compared to the 2016–2019 period (Dixon and others, 2020; Cameron and others, 2023; Orr and others, 2023). Photographs taken by passing airplanes in March, shortly after the ML 3.47 earthquake of March 6, show small snow-free areas and minor steaming at the summit of the volcano (fig. 31). Satellite imagery of Great Sitkin Volcano acquired in June and July indicated weakly elevated surface temperatures.Figure 29.  Time series of cumulative seismic moment for all earthquakes located within 20 kilometers of the summit of Great Sitkin Volcano between 2015 and 2021.

After two weeks with no sign of eruption activity, AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to YELLOW and ADVISORY on April 1, 2020.The volcano emitted steam and SO2 regularly throughout the spring and summer (fig. 35), and by June 15, the crater lake had mostly dried up. Planet Labs and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery from June 21 captured an ash deposit extending nearly 4 km southward from the north cone crater, accompanied by robust steam emissions and a high-temperature short-wave infrared anomaly within the crater (fig. 34C, D). The appearance of this deposit was associated with ground-coupled airwaves detected on June 16 and 17, but no infrasound. Seismicity at the volcano initially remained elevated, appearing as low-level tremor and small earthquakes, but AVO detected no further explosions in 2020 and its activity waned in the fall. An outage of local real-time monitoring data began on November 11, 2020. Considering the absence of data, the lack of eruptive activity detected since June, and the decaying trend in seismicity, AVO changed the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level of Semisopochnoi Island to UNASSIGINED on November 20, 2020.01/01/202004/01/202007/01/202010/01/2020DateD01/01/2021Data outage0510RSAM (counts)×105CBAEXPLANATIONPlumes and depositsSO2 plumeAmbiguous plumeSteam plumeAsh depositThermal emissionsBarely elevatedModerately elevatedInfrasound detectionSporadic tremor burstsGround-coupled airwavesEXPLANATIONORANGE YELLOWUNASSIGNEDFigure 33.  Chronology of activity at Semisopochnoi Island, Alaska, in 2020.

These deformation data are supplemented with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) imagery (for example, Lee and others, 2010).Observations from these multiple sources inherently relate data to several different datums. Ash altitudes are listed in feet above sea level (ASL) with their metric conversion given in parentheses. Ash altitudes are commonly from PIREPs or, for ash resuspension events from the National Weather Service, are based on analysis of satellite imagery, and the altitudes given herein can be somewhat imprecise. Earthquake depths are modeled in relation to the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 1984), and the accuracy of depth given directly relates to how many stations were used to record the event (that is, accuracy of depth decreases with less recording stations). The summit elevations of the volcanoes are derived from the 2019 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data. These elevations may differ from past AVO annual summaries, which were taken directly from the AVO database (https://avo.alaska.edu/).With this information, AVO assigns each monitored volcano an Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level, which indicate its current activity status (Gardner and Guffanti, 2006). No assignment is given to unmonitored volcanoes at background activity levels. The Aviation Color Code addresses the hazards to aviation posed by a volcano, whereas the Volcano Alert Level addresses the hazards on the ground. Although the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level are usually changed upward or downward together, certain situations may dictate that they are changed independently.

The volcano is a broad, truncated, and deeply glaciated stratovolcano with a summit caldera ~3 km in diameter. The summit is capped by an icefield with an area of ~40 km2, but as the ice cover has retreated, a small intracaldera cinder cone hosting a turquoise-colored lake, abundant fumaroles, and an ice cauldron has become a conspicuous feature. Makushin Volcano has had 18 confirmed historical eruptions, the most recent of which took place on January 30, 1995, and which consisted of a small summit explosion that ejected ash to an altitude of ~8,000 ft (~2,400 m) ASL (McGimsey and Neal, 1996; Begét and others, 2000).Seismic activity near Makushin Volcano increased beginning in the summer of 2020. An earthquake swarm (fig. 17) kicked off on June 15 at 21:16 UTC (13:16 AKDT) with an earthquake of local magnitude (ML) 4.2 that was located ~12 km east-southeast of the volcano. This event was followed by hundreds of aftershocks in the same general area with several of ML 3–4, including a ML 4.1 earthquake on June 16 at 00:34 UTC (June 15 at 16:34 AKDT). The two ML 4 earthquakes and many of their aftershocks were felt strongly by residents of the City of Unalaska. The earthquake depths during this period ranged from 5 to 14 km.Elevated seismicity near the volcano continued for the remainder of 2020, although the events gradually decreased in frequency over time (fig. 18).

It makes up most of the north half of Great Sitkin Island, part of the Andreanof Islands group of the central Aleutian Islands (Waythomas and others, 2003a, 2003b). The volcano has an older collapsed caldera and a younger parasitic cone, the latter of which contains a summit crater 2–3 km in diameter with a steep-sided dome in its center. Great Sitkin Volcano most recently experienced a small phreatic eruption in 2019, but it erupted at least twice in the 20th century. An eruption in 1974 produced a lava dome in the summit crater and one recorded ash cloud, which reached a maximum altitude of ~10,000 ft (~3,000 m) ASL (Associated Press, 1974). In 1945, a poorly documented eruption also created a lava dome that was then partially destroyed by the 1974 eruption. An additional eruption at Great Sitkin Volcano is not precisely dated but occurred within the past 280 years. This event produced pyroclastic flows that partially filled a valley on the southwest flank of the volcano (Waythomas and others, 2003b).In late July 2016, Great Sitkin Volcano entered a period of increased unrest characterized by an elevated frequency of earthquakes (fig. 27), anomalous steaming from its summit crater, and small explosive events (Dixon and others, 2020). Similar small earthquakes and steaming from the summit crater continued throughout 2020.AVO located 3,393 earthquakes at Great Sitkin Volcano during 2020 (fig. 28), a large increase from earlier years. This increase may, in part, reflect network upgrades made during the 2019 field season that replaced older analog sensors with broadband sensors capable of digital telemetry. This new instrumentation has proven more reliable at Great Sitkin Volcano than the older equipment, improving AVO’s ability to detect and locate earthquakes in the area.In late January 2020, Great Sitkin Volcano began to experience an increase in earthquake activity that was interpreted as unrelated to the recently improved seismic detection capabilities (fig. 27), prompting AVO to raise the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to YELLOW and ADVISORY on February 26. This activity peaked in late March and then slowly declined throughout the remainder of 2020. In response to the declining rates of seismicity, the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were lowered back to GREEN and NORMAL on October 21. No seismic or infrasound signals indicative of explosive events were detected at the volcano during 2020.The hypocenters of earthquakes at Great Sitkin Volcano in 2020 were principally clustered within the shallow crust, extending from the summit to roughly 10 km depth below sea level (fig. 28). Earthquakes were also recorded at depths between 10 and 35 km; these had waveforms and frequency contents suggesting both volcano-tectonic (VT) and deep Local magnitudeABC20162017201820192020YearEarthquakes per week40020000−10−20−30−2024Depth, in kilometersFigure 27.  Plots of earthquake data for Great Sitkin Volcano, Alaska, from 2015 through 2020, showing the number of hypocenters determined each month (A), earthquake hypocentral depths (B), and earthquake magnitudes (C).

It is located on the Alaska Peninsula, ~60 km northeast of the City of Cold Bay, Alaska, and 950 km southwest of Anchorage (fig. 1). Eruptions at Pavlof Volcano range in style from Strombolian to Vulcanian (Waythomas and others, 2006), and with at least 37 eruptions since 1790, it is considered one of the most active volcanoes in North America (Miller and others, 1998). The volcano is dominantly an open-vent system, and many of its eruptions have little precursory seismicity or ground deformation visible in InSAR (Lu and Dzurisin, 2014; Pesicek and others, 2018). The last significant eruption at Pavlof Volcano was in March 2016 and was characterized by continuous seismic tremor, infrasound detections, and lightning accompanying an ash cloud that rose to a maximum altitude of ~30,000 ft (~9,100 m) ASL (Fee and others, 2017; Cameron and others, 2020).Elevated seismicity levels in late December 2019 prompted AVO to raise the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level of Pavlof Volcano to YELLOW and ADVISORY on December 28, 2019 (Orr and others, 2023). During January and February 2020, more periods of low-level tremor and minor steaming at the volcano summit were noted, but no other outward signs of unrest were observed and no eruptive activity occurred (fig. 4). In response to declining seismicity, AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to GREEN and NORMAL on March 3. On June 22, AVO detected a 10-minute-long period of weak seismic tremor and a weak impulsive infrasound signal from Pavlof Volcano that may have been associated with robust gas emissions there. This activity did not lead to any outward signs of unrest and no eruption was confirmed, so the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were not changed. Three months of quiescence followed. Then, on September 21–22, periods of harmonic tremor were detected at the volcano. This new activity was considered an increase above background levels, so AVO raised the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to YELLOW and ADVISORY on September 21. Although periods of weaker harmonic tremor continued sporadically thereafter through December, the volcano showed no other signs of increasing unrest, and only minor steaming was observed at its summit. The Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were lowered to GREEN and NORMAL on October 14.Figure 4.  Time series of Aviation Color Codes (A) and graph of earthquakes and tremor episodes (B) at Pavlof Volcano, Alaska, in 2020.

However, several deep long-period (LP) earthquakes (depths greater than 9 km) were recorded beneath the volcano’s summit prior to and during the June swarm. These LP events may represent magma movement in the lower crust, although such earthquakes are not unusual for Makushin Volcano.At the time of the swarm, AVO was uncertain whether the earthquake sources were related to tectonic or volcanic stresses. Therefore, on June 16, a seismic watch schedule was implemented, and the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were raised to YELLOW and ADVISORY. On September 8, after seismic activity had returned to background levels and no other signs of volcanic unrest were observed, the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were lowered back to GREEN and NORMAL.By analyzing the fault plane solutions of the earthquakes in the swarm, Lanza and others (2022) found that many of the larger earthquakes had P-axes oriented consistently with the regional maximum compression, but most of the smaller earthquakes had P-axes perpendicular to the regional maximum compression. On the basis of these findings, they concluded that the triggering mechanism of the earthquakes was most likely a combination of stresses from tectonic and magmatic sources along existing fault lines.Mount ClevelandGVP #31124052.822°, −169.945°1,745 mChuginadak Island, Islands of Four Mountains, Aleutian IslandsELEVATED SURFACE TEMPERATURES; EXPLOSIVE ERUPTIONMount Cleveland forms the west side of the uninhabited Chuginadak Island, part of the Islands of Four Mountains group in the east-central Aleutian Islands (figs. 1, 19).

Historical eruptions of the volcano have been characterized by short-lived ash explosions, lava fountaining, lava flows, and pyroclastic flows. In February 2001, after 6 years of quiescence, Mount Cleveland had three explosive events that sent ash to altitudes as high as ~30,000 ft (~9,100 m) ASL, produced a pyroclastic flow that reached the ocean, and erupted a blocky lava flow (Dean and others, 2004; McGimsey and others, 2005). ```"

The ancestral Atka volcano was destroyed during the Pleistocene, forming a 5-kilometer-diameter caldera (Myers and others, 2002). The complex now consists of four post-caldera cones, at least two of which have been active in the Holocene (Mount Kliuchef and Korovin Volcano).

Its two main summit vents and the northeastern most vent appear to be young—the northeasternmost vent was probably the source of an 1812 eruption attributed to nearby Sarichef Volcano (Wood and Kienle, 1990). Korovin Volcano, in contrast, has a pronounced summit crater measuring ~1 km in diameter and several hundred meters deep. This crater, in turn, contains a small lake (Wood and Kienle, 1990). Korovin Volcano was the source of small eruptions in 1973, 1987, and 1998.The first indication of unrest at Atka volcanic complex in 2020 was a small increase in seismic activity. This activity started in early June and culminated with episodic tremor on June 11–12. The amplitude of the tremor pulses, which each lasted 10–40 minutes, increased slowly and peaked on June 12 at ~13:50 UTC (~04:50 HADT). The tremor then subsided to background levels for the next several months.Beginning on October 15, the TROPOMI satellite instrument made occasional SO2 detections (fig. 26) at Atka volcanic complex. These SO2 detections were the first at the complex in 2020 and indicated elevated volcanic degassing. An additional two satellite SO2 detections were made during the next two weeks, which also coincided with an increase in the number of earthquakes located in the area. In response to this heightened level of activity, AVO elevated the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to YELLOW and ADVISORY on October 28. No additional satellite SO2 detections were made in the following weeks, and seismicity declined in late November, indicating a return to background activity. AVO subsequently lowered the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level back to GREEN and NORMAL on December 3.Figure 26.  TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite image of sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas emissions from Korovin Volcano, a subfeature of Atka volcanic complex, Alaska, on October 15, 2020.```"

The island’s largest feature is a 7-kilometer-wide caldera that formed 6,900–5,000 years ago, but it also has many post-caldera cones (Coombs and others, 2018). The last recorded eruption before the volcano’s ongoing activity (which started in 2018) took place in 1987 at Sugarloaf Peak, located on the south end of the island. This event produced a 90-kilometer-long plume visible in satellite images, and pilots later reported ash deposited on the volcano’s flanks (Reeder, 1990). Mount Young, a cluster of three cones within Semisopochnoi Island’s caldera, has also erupted repeatedly in the Holocene, producing crystal-rich basaltic andesite lavas and tephra from all three cones. Most fall deposits associated with the cones are consistent with small- to moderate-sized ash clouds, although some lapilli-size units indicate eruption intensities with a volcanic explosivity index as high as 3 (Coombs and others, 2018). The most recent non-eruptive unrest at the volcano prior to its ongoing eruption was a period of increased seismicity and deformation in 2014–2015. Modeling by DeGrandpre and others (2019) explained this as the result of the rapid intrusion of 0.072 km3 of magma (as two batches) into a spheroidal magma storage zone ~8 km beneath the caldera.Renewed activity at Semisopochnoi Island began in September 2018 and continued through 2020. This eruption was characterized by (1) low-level ash emissions that occasionally produced local deposits, (2) geophysical indications of small explosions, and (3) steam and gas emissions from the north cone of Mount Young (fig. 32). The local monitoring network documented seismic activity for nearly the full year, but a network outage began on November 11 and continued through the end of 2020. Regional infrasound arrays and satellite remote sensing supported the monitoring of explosive activity and emissions.Explosive activity and seismic tremor were recorded at Semisopochnoi Island at the end of 2019 (on December 19 and 29, respectively), so the volcano began 2020 at an Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level of ORANGE and WATCH (fig. 33) (Orr and others, 2023). A pause followed Figure 32.  Satellite image of Semisopochnoi Island in the Rat Islands, Alaska, showing active and recently active volcanic features.

The overall seismicity remained elevated, however, and on February 15, a series of small explosions and tremor bursts were detected. No ash emissions or deposits were identified in satellite imagery, which was frequently cloudy, but the seismic activity led AVO to return the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to ORANGE and WATCH. Seismicity did not increase further and clear imagery later confirmed the volcano was not erupting, although steam emissions were visible. On February 26, AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to YELLOW and ADVISORY. Activity in mid-March was characterized by nearly continuous tremor and frequent, small explosion signals, but no observations of ash plumes. Regional infrasound arrays detected an explosion at the volcano on March 11, followed by more on March 15–16, all of which were accompanied by ground-coupled airwaves recorded on the local seismic network. During this March explosive period, a dark ash deposit appeared around the north cone of Mount Young (fig. 34A) and TROPOMI imagery showed a possible SO2 plume.

Featuring an ice-filled caldera 10 km in diameter and with a total volume of ~350 km3, it is one of the largest and most active volcanoes of the Aleutian Arc (Miller and others, 1998; Bacon and others, 2009). Extensive pyroclastic flow deposits around the volcano indicate two caldera-forming eruptions have taken place during the Holocene (Miller and Smith, 1987). Mount Veniaminof has also erupted at least 20 times in the past 200 years alone, all from its ~300-meter-high intracaldera cone. Its most recent eruption was in 2018 (Cameron and others, 2018; Waythomas, 2021). Mount Veniaminof did not erupt in 2020, but it did experience a period of elevated seismicity. Beginning on June 14, 2020, this seismicity was characterized by brief periods of continuous tremor (each lasting ~30 seconds to several minutes) and occasional earthquakes (fig. 3). Although no other signs of unrest were observed, this departure from the volcano’s background seismic activity prompted AVO to increase its Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to YELLOW and ADVISORY on June 18. The seismicity changed little until early August, when the level of tremor began to gradually decline. The decrease in seismic activity and the lack of evidence for surface change (no increased temperatures or gas emissions) indicated that activity at Mount Veniaminof had returned to background levels.

A steam plume, sometimes containing a minor amount of entrained ash, often emanates from the volcano’s small summit crater. Shishaldin Volcano is one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian Arc (Miller and others, 1998); most of its historical eruptions comprised small ash and steam plumes, although an eruption in April–May 1999 produced a subplinian ash cloud (Nye and others, 2002).Shishaldin Volcano erupted from July 2019 to March 2020 (fig. 5). The 2019 activity was documented in Orr and others (2023) and the 2020 activity is documented herein.

These observations are archived in an internal database structure to assist in retrieving past records. A second rotation of scientists from AVO and the USGS National Earthquake Information Center monitors the volcanoes that have local seismometers and analyzes activity detected on regional infrasound sensors. Each day, this team compiles three separate reports, spaced ~8 hours apart. These reports are also catalogued within a relational database.The volcanoes in this publication are presented in geographic order from east to west along the Aleutian Arc. Each entry has a title block containing information about that volcano: its identifier number (#) assigned by the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program (GVP); its latitude, longitude, and summit elevation; the name of its geographic region; and an abbreviated summary of its 2020 activity. The title block is followed by a description of the volcano and a summary of its past activity, then a detailed account of its activity in 2020, often with accompanying figures. This information is derived from formal public AVO information products, internal online electronic logs compiled by AVO staff, and published material (such as Miller and others [1998]). AVO sometimes uses informal volcano names for clarity; the names provided by the official U.S. Board on Geographic Names (through the Geographic Names Information System) may match imprecisely with the volcanoes themselves. For example, Bogoslof volcano comprises more islands than Bogoslof Island. Alaska also has volcanoes without official place names, such as Takawangha volcano, which require the use of informal names. In this report, volcano locations (in decimal degrees latitude and longitude) are taken from AVO’s database of Alaskan volcanoes (Cameron and others, 2022). Measurements are presented in the International System of Units, except for altitudes, which are reported in feet (ft) ASL, in line with federal aviation standards, followed by meters (m). General date references are given in coordinated universal time (UTC) unless specified otherwise. Most volcanoes in Alaska are in the Alaska standard time (AKST) or Alaska daylight time (AKDT) zones, but all Aleutian volcanoes west of Umnak Island (see the community of Nikolski, Alaska, on figure 1) are in the Hawaii-Aleutian standard time (HAST) or Hawaii-Aleutian daylight time (HADT) zones. During 2020, daylight saving time ran from March 8 to November 1.What is a “Historically Active Volcano”?AVO defines an active volcano as a volcanic center that has recently had an eruption (see “What is an ‘eruption’ ”) or a period of intense deformation, seismic activity, or fumarolic activity; these are inferred to reflect the presence of magma at shallow levels beneath the volcano. AVO considers the historical period in Alaska to be since 1741, when written records of volcanic activity began. On the basis of a rigorous reanalysis of all volcanic activity accounts in Alaska (from many sources), Cameron and others (2018) concluded that 54 Alaskan volcanoes fit these criteria. In this report, we modify the number of historically active volcanoes to 52, because we consider (1) Korovin Volcano and Mount Kliuchef to be subfeatures of Atka volcanic complex and (2) Novarupta to be a subfeature of Mount Katmai. As geologic understanding of Alaskan volcanoes improves through additional fieldwork and modern radiometric dating techniques, our list of active volcanoes will continue to evolve.What is an “Eruption”?The specific use of the term “eruption” varies from scientist to scientist and has no universally agreed-upon definition. Here, we adopt the usage of Siebert and others (2010, p. 17), who define eruptions as “* * * events that involve the explosive ejection of fragmental material, the effusion of liquid lava, or both.” The critical elements of this definition are the verbs “ejection” and “effusion,” which refer to dynamic surface processes that pose some level of hazard. The presence or absence of “juvenile material,” or newly erupted rock, which can sometimes be ambiguous, is not relevant to this use of the term eruption, particularly when communicating a potential hazard. This definition does not, however, include passive volcanic degassing or hydrothermal fluid discharge.```"

The 1912 Novarupta-Katmai eruption—the largest eruption of the 20th century—produced ~17 cubic kilometers (km3) of fall deposits and 11 km3 of pyroclastic material that filled nearby valleys around the volcano (Hildreth and Fierstein, 2012). The pyroclastic deposit in these valleys is as much as 200 m thick, and some areas remain almost entirely devoid of vegetation more than a century after the eruption. When the landscape is snow-free, and particularly when the ground has little moisture content, strong winds can pick up this ash and create large ash clouds. The wind can then transport the resuspended ash, most often southeastward across Shelikof Strait, Kodiak Island, and the Gulf of Alaska. These ash clouds are often seen by individuals downwind and are recorded in satellite imagery, where they commonly appear to originate from a broad area rather than a specific volcanic source. Although they look similar to dispersing volcanic ash clouds in satellite imagery, the clouds are not the result of concurrent volcanic activity. This resuspension phenomenon has been observed and documented many times over the last several decades (Hadley and others, 2004; Wallace and Schwaiger, 2019), including three times in 2020.On September 14 (AKDT), strong winds entrained and resuspended ash from the Katmai region, carrying it northwest­ward at an altitude of ~4,000 ft (~1,200 m). Strong winds again picked up ash on October 31 (AKDT), carrying it southward at an altitude of ~5,000 ft (~1,500 m), as well as on November 2 (AKDT), carrying the ash southeastward at an altitude of ~5,000 ft (~1,500 m) (fig. 2). During each resuspension event, the National Weather Service Alaska Aviation Weather Unit issued a significant meteorological weather advisory for aviators and AVO issued an information statement. The Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level remained GREEN and NORMAL for Mount Katmai during 2020.SHELIKOF STRAITALASKA PENINSULAKODIAK ISLANDResuspendedashMount Katmai (Novarupta)Figure 2.  Oblique, true-color satellite image (looking north) showing a resuspended ash plume extending from the Novarupta region across Shelikof Strait to Kodiak Island, southwest Alaska.

sir20245004.pdf,"media/sir20245004.pdf:```Volcanic Activity in Alaska, East to West Along the Aleutian Arc    11Shishaldin Volcano began 2020 with an Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level of ORANGE and WATCH. Elevated surface temperatures visible in satellite data on January 2 suggested that weak eruptive activity, confined to the vent, was occurring. Seismicity began to increase on January 3, indicating increasing eruptive activity. This was confirmed by a passing pilot, who reported a clear view of lava fountaining and a robust, steam-rich plume that probably contained some ash from the fountaining (fig. 7). At the same time (starting around 19:00 UTC [10:00 AKST]), satellite views and additional PIREPs recorded ash-poor plumes from the volcano that may have reached as high as ~24,000 ft (~7,300 m) ASL. The fountaining at Shishaldin Volcano was associated with increasing seismic tremor and the emplacement of lava flows mostly concentrated on the volcano’s northwest flank. AVO issued a VAN at 20:38 UTC (11:38 AKST) but did not change the Aviation Color Code or Volcano Alert Level.Seismic tremor decreased sharply at 20:48 UTC (11:48 AKST), and at about the same time, a PIREP indicated that the plume height had risen to ~27,000 ft (~8,200 m) ASL. Volcanic lightning was detected at 21:07 UTC (12:09 AKST), suggesting that the concentration of ash in the plume had increased. These ash emissions did not last long; the concentration was decreasing by 21:30 UTC (12:30 AKST). A WorldView-2 satellite image acquired at 22:22 UTC (13:22 AKST) revealed the state of the volcano: the lava flows active earlier in the day had stalled and were cooling, new lobate pyroclastic flow deposits had been emplaced on the west and south flanks, and an ash-rich plume was drifting southeastward (fig. 8A). The new pyroclastic flow deposits were the first to affect the south flank of the volcano during this eruption; prior deposits were restricted to the north flank. Deposition on the west and south flanks of the volcano required overtopping the topographic high point of the summit crater, suggesting they were deposits from the collapse of an ash column as opposed to debris from a tephra cone collapse. Eruptive activity associated with the January 3 event was not observed directly afterward.

Light ashfall from this event was reported in the City of Cold Bay.The plume appeared to have detached from the vent by 22:00 UTC (13:00 AKST), indicating that ash emission had slowed or stopped. The Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were subsequently lowered to ORANGE and WATCH on January 8 at 04:17 UTC (January 7 at 19:17 AKST). Synthetic aperture radar images acquired later that day showed that the crater had deepened, and the cone had subsided or collapsed. Like the January 3 event, the January 7 paroxysm was followed by a period of quiescence. The only activity detections at Shishaldin Volcano over the next week were infrasound signals consistent with Strombolian activity on January 10. On January 14, a clear WorldView-2 satellite image showed no volcanic activity within the summit crater or on the flanks.Eruptive activity increased again on January 18; lava flows were visible on the volcano flanks and seismic tremor intensified (fig. 6). At 17:18 UTC (08:18 AKST), a pilot reported visible lava but no ash emissions. Observers in the Cities of Cold Bay and King Cove, Alaska, documented the incandescent lava flow during clear weather that evening (fig. 9B). Overnight webcam images from the south flank of Isanotski Volcano also showed lava fountaining, and by January 19 at 9:30 UTC (00:30 AKST), satellite images showed an ash-poor gas plume rising as high as ~18,000 ft (~5,500 m) ASL. The level of activity continued to increase, and as a result, the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were increased to RED and WARNING at 17:28 UTC (08:28 AKST). By this point, a continuous, 150-kilometer-long plume was visible in satellite images. PIREPs at 18:15 UTC (09:15 AKST) described ongoing lava flow activity and measured that the plume had reached an altitude of ~25,000 ft (~7,600 m) ASL. Over the following hours, seismic tremor continued to increase and trace ashfall was reported in the City of False Pass, Alaska, 38 km northeast of Shishaldin Volcano. A WorldView-2 image captured activity at the vent during this period (fig. 8B). Another PIREP at 21:42 UTC (12:42 AKST) indicated that the plume had climbed to ~30,000 ft (~9,100 m) ASL (fig. 11A).The seismic tremor dropped precipitously just after 00:00 UTC on January 20 (January 19 at 15:00 AKST). Satellite data acquired about an hour later showed that the plume had transitioned to a more ash-rich composition, a change confirmed by PIREPs (fig. 11B). Ash emissions continued for the next several hours (fig. 10B). Then, shortly before 05:00 UTC (20:00 AKST), ash emissions stopped and the plume detached from the vent. With the cessation of eruptive activity at the vent, AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to ORANGE and WATCH at 09:37 UTC (00:37 AKST).Prolonged Eruption Hiatus (January 20–March 11)Satellite data after the January 20 paroxysm showed new ash deposition—the ash-poor lava fountaining phase produced trace deposits extending northeastward toward False Pass, whereas the later ash-rich phase produced more substantial deposits extending southeastward (fig. 12). Satellite radar imagery also showed that the volcano crater was larger and deeper after the event.

C, WorldView-3 image acquired March 22, 2020 (22:32 UTC; 14:32 AKDT), showing steaming from the summit crater. Inset image (same scale) shows saturated SWIR bands in the summit crater again. D, WorldView-2 image acquired April 2, 2020 (22:08 UTC; 14:08 AKDT), showing light steaming and no eruptive activity within the summit crater. The images are not orthorectified which results in distance offset owing to satellite viewing angle and terrain. On April 16 at 19:44 UTC (11:44 AKDT), the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were lowered to GREEN and NORMAL, reflecting an overall decrease of activity to background levels at the volcano, although AVO continued recording evidence of additional minor collapse events using satellite radar images. Some of these events appeared to produce trace ash deposits on the upper flanks, as seen on April 29 and May 7. AVO workers carrying out annual geophysics station maintenance in August and September did not observe any eruptive activity, but helicopter gas surveys at the same time detected continued SO2 degassing at an emission rate of 100±30 metric tons per day. The surveys also measured high carbon dioxide concentrations relative to measurements from 2015 and 2019, which indicated a new deep magma input into the system.Final Deposits and SamplesThe 2019–2020 eruption of Shishaldin Volcano resulted in (1) many lava flows on the north flank of the volcano, (2) pyroclastic flow deposits related to cone collapse events in December and three eruption paroxysms in January, and (3) lahars that inundated drainages north of the volcano and reached the Bering Sea coast. Accurate mapping of the lava flows was difficult because of poor orthorectification in many of the available high-resolution satellite images, in turn caused by the typically oblique image viewing angles and the steep flanks of Shishaldin Volcano.Satellite images taken on January 14 and January 25 provided close-to-nadir images (11º and 17º off nadir, respectively) that allowed the final deposits to be mapped with reasonable accuracy (fig. 14). The lava flows covered less than 0.9 square kilometers (km2) and extended as far as 3 km from the vent, primarily occupying three distinct drainages, with each new flow burying the previous one. The pyroclastic flow and lahar deposits were gradational and, in many places, difficult to distinguish from each other in satellite images. Deposits on the volcano’s south flank, especially those from the January 3 paroxysm, were likely all pyroclastic flows generated from ash column collapse that overtopped the high point on the crater rim (fig. 8). The lahars and pyroclastic flows to the north were intermixed, forming lobate deposits on the ```"

Hot debris landing on snow may have triggered some of these flows by melting and remobilizing mixtures of debris and snow. Satellite imagery acquired after the explosion also showed a trace ash deposit extending southward from the summit, discoloring the snow on the volcano’s flanks (fig. 24).

A white steam plume, presumably from a lava flow melting glacial ice around the flank vent, appears in the image center. Copyrighted by A. Shangin, (2021); used with permission. B, Satellite image acquired on March 7, 2021, showing an ashy plume erupting from Cone A and a small, white steam plume emanating from a melt pit northeast of the cone.Less intense activity characterized the second half of March at Mount Veniaminof. Two seismic stations at the volcano came back online on March 12, allowing AVO geophysicists to detect tremor and LP earthquakes once again. Tremor was detected daily, whereas explosions and ash plumes were detected less frequently. Thermal anomalies from lava effusion were weaker in the second half of the month than in the first half. Lava effusion and minor ash emissions likely continued within the caldera throughout much of this time, although observations were limited to those on clear weather days. Ash plume altitudes remained lower than ~10,000 ft (~3,000 m) ASL. Although not reported, webcam imagery suggested that trace amounts of ash fell in Perryville on March 27, making it the only day during the eruption when a community may have been impacted by ash.On April 1, the eruption paused and the volcano showed only slightly elevated surface temperatures, which were probably related to cooling lava flows. The Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were lowered to YELLOW and ADVISORY on April 2 in response to this decreased activity. However, an ash plume on April 5 prompted AVO to raise the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level back to ORANGE and WATCH. A second ash plume was observed on April 6. No eruptive activity was observed thereafter, so the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were lowered to YELLOW and ADVISORY on April 21, then back to UNASSIGNED on May 12. Elevated surface temperatures detected in the weeks after the pause were most likely related to a warm summit cone and cooling lava flows (fig. 21). Altogether, the three lava flows that erupted within the glacial melt pit covered a combined area of ~2.7×104 m2 (Waythomas, 2021). AVO workers fully restored the Mount Veniaminof local seismic network during a field campaign in late June and early July. The Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were consequently changed to GREEN and NORMAL on July 8. Tremor, steam plumes, SO2 emissions, and thermal anomalies were detected in geophysical and remote sensing data shortly before and during the field campaign, which ran from June 28 to July 5. However, the field crew itself observed no noteworthy activity (fig. 21). No further unrest took place at Mount Veniaminof for the remainder of 2021. Tephra samples were collected from a snow pit ~2 km east of cone A, adjacent to the melt pit (fig. 21), during the field campaign. Four distinct tephra layers were sampled; each consisted of black and red-oxidized grains intermixed with loose plagioclase crystals. Each layer had a modal grain size of 0.25–0.5 millimeter (mm) and a maximum grain size of 2 mm. One layer also had apparent accretionary lapilli. Petrographic analysis of the samples showed that the phenocrysts, like those sampled from the 2018 eruption (Loewen and others 2021), comprised normally zoned plagioclase (fig. 22A, B), olivine (fig. 22C), and rare clinopyroxene. The groundmass was a mixture of microlitic sideromelane (fig. 22D), tachylyte, and lithic components. The glass composition was similar to that erupted in 2018, although with slightly lower silica concentrations (like the 2013 eruption glass). ```"

Orr,1 Hannah R. Dietterich,1 David Fee,2 Társilo Girona,2 Ronni Grapenthin,2 Matthew M. Haney,1 Matthew W. Loewen,1 John J. Lyons,1 John A. Power,1 Hans F. Schwaiger,1 David J. Schneider,1 Darren Tan,2 Liam Toney,2 Valerie K. Wasser,2 and Christopher F. Waythomas11 U.S. Geological Survey.2 University of Alaska Fairbanks.AbstractIn 2021, the Alaska Volcano Observatory responded to eruptions, volcanic unrest or suspected unrest, increased seismicity, and other significant activity at 15 volcanic centers in Alaska and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Eruptive activity in Alaska consisted of repeated small, ash-producing, phreatomagmatic explosions from Mount Young on Semisopochnoi Island; an explosion at Great Sitkin Volcano followed by the eruption of a thick lava flow that filled and overflowed the summit crater; weak explosive activity and the eruption of small, channelized flows at Pavlof Volcano; and a short-lived eruption at Mount Veniaminof that produced ash emissions from an intracaldera cone, as well as lava flows confined to a melt pit in the ice mantling the cone’s flank. Mount Cleveland had a period of unrest, but no eruptive activity took place there. Anomalous seismicity was also detected at Atka volcanic complex, Mount Gareloi, and Davidof volcano. New warm springs opened and deposited mud at the summit and north base of Shrub mud volcano. Other activity of note in Alaska consisted of large ice and rock avalanches at Iliamna Volcano and Mount Spurr, ash resuspension events at Mount Katmai and Aniakchak Crater, and anomalous deformation at Mount Okmok that was consistent with a shallow intrusion of magma. In the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands, a brief, ash-producing eruption occurred at Mount Pagan.IntroductionThe Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) is a joint program of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute, and the Alaska Division of Geological & Geophysical Surveys. AVO was formed in 1988 and uses Federal, State, and university resources to (1) monitor and study Alaska’s hazardous volcanoes (fig. 1) in order to assess the nature, timing, and likelihood of volcanic activity; (2) assess volcanic hazards associated with anticipated activity, including the kinds of events, their effects, and areas at risk; and (3) provide timely and accurate information on volcanic hazards, and warnings of impending dangerous activity, to officials (local, State, and Federal) and the public. The USGS branch of AVO also monitors the volcanoes in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) (fig. 1).This report summarizes notable unrest and other kinds of activity associated with volcanoes in Alaska and the CNMI during 2021 (tables 1, 2) and briefly describes AVO’s response. It contains information about all identified volcanic unrest, even if no formal public notification was issued at the time. Observations, images, and information that are typically not published elsewhere are included in this report. Similar summaries of volcanic unrest and AVO’s response have been published annually since 1992.The AVO volcano monitoring program involves daily analyses of satellite and webcam imagery, seismicity, and infrasound detections; occasional overflights and ground visits; airborne and ground-based gas measurements; and the compilation of visual observations taken from observatory personnel members, residents, mariners, and pilot weather reports (PIREP; reports of meteorological phenomena encountered by aircraft in flight). AVO also receives real-time ground deformation data from permanent Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations at eight Alaskan volcanoes: Akutan Peak, Augustine Volcano, Makushin Volcano, Mount Okmok, Redoubt Volcano, Shishaldin Volcano, Mount Spurr, and Westdahl volcano (an ice-clad edifice with no formal name that occupies the west end of Unimak Island). These deformation data are supplemented with Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) imagery (for example, Lee and others, 2010).Observations from these multiple sources inherently relate data to several different datums. Ash altitudes are commonly from PIREPs or, for ash resuspension events from the National Weather Service, are based on analysis of satellite imagery, and the altitudes given herein can be somewhat imprecise. Earthquake depths are modeled in relation to the World Geodetic System of 1984 (WGS 1984), and the accuracy of depth given directly relates to how many stations were used to record the event (that is, accuracy of depth ```"
sir20245014.pdf,"media/sir20245014.pdf:```24    2021 Volcanic Activity in Alaska—Summary of Events and Response of the Alaska Volcano Observatoryhistorical eruptions of Pavlof Volcano have been characterized by lava fountaining or jetting that result in the accumulation of spatter around the vent. Occasionally, these growing spatter piles become unstable and collapse, forming hot particulate flows that are capable of eroding and melting glacier ice and snow on the volcano. The formation of meltwater by this process is a primary mechanism for lahar generation at Pavlof Volcano (Waythomas and others, 2017). The eruptive activity in early November may have been characterized by such periods of lava fountaining, spatter accumulation, and the extrusion of hot, granular flows that produced the lahar deposits observed in satellite imagery (fig. 27). A Sentinel-2 short-wave infrared (SWIR) image from November 12 showed a circular area of hot material around the active vent, consistent with the notion that spatter accumulation had been occurring. However, none of the webcam views or occasional pilot reports from November and December confirmed incandescence or lava fountaining at the south flank vent. On November 17, satellite observations indicated both the presence of ballistic clasts around the vent (some located as far as 2.5 km away) and continued lahar development that was likely associated with ongoing lava-ice-snow interaction. The ballistic clasts were ejected during energetic explosions that were recorded in seismic and infrasound data during the ?????????????????????HeadscarpBase from Digital Globe, WorldView-3 satellite image acquired December 1, 2021  NorthwestflankSoutheastflank55.419°−161.894°−161.860°55.409°01 KILOMETER0.500.250.5 MILES2016 CraterTrace ash-fall depositsSnow-avalanche deposits2021 ventSpatter, ash, and debris depositsDiffuse field of small ballistic particlesLahar depositsApproximate boundaryTopographic divideUnknown or uncertain boundaryIndividual ballistic particleEXPLANATION?Figure 28.  Annotated map of features and deposits on the southeast flank of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska.

The east flow margin advanced onto the ice, melting it and causing fracturing and collapse of the ice near the flow front, but only producing minor steaming. By the end of 2021, the lava flow covered 1.3 square kilometers and had an estimated total volume of 0.031 km3. The dome within the summit crater was ~1,230 m wide (in its east-west direction), whereas the west, south, and north flow lobes were ~830, ~865, and ~180 m long, respectively. Slow effusion continued into 2022.During 2021, AVO located 966 earthquakes near Great Sitkin Volcano (fig. 50), ranging in ML from −1.1 to 2.1 and in depth from −1.8 to 32.04 km below sea level (negative depths reflect height above sea level). Most hypocenters clustered between 0 and 10 km depth beneath the Great Sitkin Volcano edifice (fig. 50). The most notable seismicity during 2021 was a ~24-hour-long swarm of LP earthquakes that immediately preceded the explosive eruption on May 25 (fig. 41).AAXXXX_fig 01ABCDNew lava domeNew lava domeNew lava domeNew lava domeNNNNBase images from German Aerospace Center and courtesy of Simon Plank, copyright 2021.0400 METERS20005001000 FEET0400 METERS20005001000 FEET0400 METERS20005001000 FEET0400 METERS20005001000 FEETFigure 48.  High-resolution satellite synthetic aperture radar amplitude spotlight imagery of the summit of Great Sitkin Volcano, Alaska, on July 23, 2021, at 5:32 coordinated universal time (UTC) (A), July 25, 2021, at 17:56 UTC (B), August 3, 2021, at 5:32 UTC (C), and August 5, 2021, at 17:56 UTC(D).

The summit elevations of the volcanoes are derived from the 2019 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data. These elevations may differ from past AVO annual summaries, which were taken directly from the AVO database (https://avo.alaska.edu/).With this information, AVO assigns each monitored volcano an Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level, which indicate its current activity status (Gardner and Guffanti, 2006). No assignment is given to unmonitored volcanoes at background level. The Aviation Color Code addresses the hazards to aviation posed by a volcano, whereas the Volcano Alert Level addresses the hazards on the ground. Although the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level are usually changed upward or downward together, certain situations may dictate that they are changed independently. For instance, a volcano may produce lava flows that are dangerous on the ground and merit a Volcano Alert Level of WARNING, but the hazard to aviation is minimal and merits an Aviation Color Code of ORANGE. Where possible, Volcano Alert Level announcements contain additional explanations of volcanic activity and expected hazards. Tables 3 and 4 define each Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level.Duty scientists are responsible for compiling all monitoring data to provide scheduled and event-driven public notices, as appropriate.

The precise timing of onset for these emissions is impossible to determine because the eruption cloud was only discernible in daytime visible-wavelength images; although thermal infrared satellite images can detect high-altitude erup­tion clouds at night (owing to the temperature contrast between the cloud and the surface beneath it), discerning low-altitude eruption clouds can be extremely difficult. Ash first appeared in a Himawari-8 satellite image acquired on September 1 at ~07:00 ChST (August 31 at ~21:00 UTC), by which time the leading edge of the cloud was ~150 km west of Mount Pagan. Subsequent satellite images showed continued ash emissions through ~23:00 ChST (13:00 UTC) on September 1.The USGS increased the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level of Mount Pagan to ORANGE and WATCH on September 2 at 04:44 ChST (September 1 at 18:44 UTC). Although the ash emissions had paused by that time, the alert level was increased on the basis of the potential for the resumption of eruptive activity. The following morning, visible-wavelength satellite data showed that ash emissions had resumed; by 10:26 ChST (00:26 UTC) on September 2, a sinuous ash plume extended more than 500 km westward at an altitude of ~10,000 ft (~3 km) ASL (fig. 67). Ash and SO2 emissions continued on a gradually declining trend through at least September 4 when high meteorological cloud cover moved into the region. Without local geophysical monitoring, the timing for the cessation of ash emissions could not be precisely determined. Clear satellite viewing conditions on September 7 showed that ash emissions had ceased, although robust steaming continued to be observed through September 10. With no observations of resumed eruptive activity, the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level were lowered from ORANGE and WATCH to YELLOW and ADVISORY on September 11 and to UNASSIGNED on September 25.Pagan IslandAgrihanAlamagan IslandGuguan Island0100 KILOMETERS25507502550 MILESNFigure 67.  True-color satellite image (from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer on the Terra satellite) showing a sinuous ash cloud extending more than 500 kilometers (km) westward from Mount Pagan at an altitude of 3 kilometers above sea level.

Diffuse ash clouds intermittently rose as high as ~12,000 ft (~3,700 m) ASL and were visible in satellite data as far as 10–15 km beyond the vent. Ash fallout during this period settled mainly on the upper south-southeast flank of the volcano, within 2–3 km of the vent. Occasional stronger ash bursts and farther-traveling ash clouds may have produced trace amounts (less than 1/32 inch or 0.8 mm) of ash fall as far as 10–15 km southeast of the vent, but this amount of ash is difficult to observe in satellite data and so could not be confirmed.On August 25 and 26, mid-infrared satellite images showed slightly elevated surface temperatures at the summit of the volcano for the first time (fig. 25). The detection of elevated surface temperatures in satellite data usually indicates that lava is at or near the surface; however, lava flows at Pavlof Volcano were not confirmed until November 8, when the thermal output at the vent increased considerably (fig. 26). The presence of shallow subsurface magma and hot gases may have contributed to the slightly elevated thermal signals observed between late August and early November. Satellite images acquired on November 11 showed an active lava flow or spatter accumulation, about 200 m in length, and associated lahar deposits (extending ~2 km beyond the vent) on the upper southeast flank of the volcano (fig. 27).

By comparison, the other Klawasi group mud volcanoes, Upper Klawasi and Lower Klawasi mud volcanoes, have historically produced minor mud discharge and weak gas emissions almost constantly. During the summer of 1996, Shrub mud volcano began to vigorously erupt carbon dioxide-rich gas and warm, saline mud (Richter and others, 1998a), producing mud flows that traveled down the flanks of its edifice and extended out from its base (fig. 3). This activity waned over the following few years, eventually evolving into a bubbling pond of muddy water ~40 m in diameter within a shallow pit near the summit. This pond made Shrub mud volcano more like Upper and Lower Klawasi mud volcanoes, which both have similar features. The summit pond has remained active since it formed, showing little change in behavior or appearance until 2021.Activity at Shrub mud volcano changed in 2017, when new springs opened on its east flank and erupted mud for several months (fig. 3) (Cameron and others, 2023). These events were followed in 2019 by the extrusion of mud from a line of new springs that opened at the base of the north flank (fig. 3) (Orr and others, 2023), in the same general area as the activity that first marked the mud volcano’s rejuvenation in 1996. This area still hosted activity when visited by AVO workers in 2021 (figs. 3, 4), although the arrangement of the springs had changed: new springs had opened and many of the older springs were no longer active. The line of springs Figure 3.  Annotated satellite image of Shrub mud volcano, Alaska, showing mud flows emplaced since its rejuvenation of activity in 1996.

In early June 2021, the equipment on Amchitka Island was repaired and the local network on Semisopochnoi Island was completely upgraded. These upgrades involved a change from analog to digital telemetry; the replacement of short-period vertical-component seismometers with three-component broadband seismometers; the addition of broadband infrasound sensors at stations CERB, CESW, and CEPE; and the addition of webcams at stations CEPE and CETU (fig. 53). A six-element infrasound array was also installed on Amchitka Island in late May 2021 to provide improved regional monitoring.Seismic activity was low prior to the network outage; thus, the first activity noted in 2021 was a satellite observation of a small ash deposit from the north cone of Mount Young on February 6. In response, AVO raised the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level from UNASSIGNED to YELLOW and ADVISORY the next day. Ash emissions appeared in satellite imagery on February 8, which led AVO to further elevate the volcano to ORANGE and WATCH.In the following months, satellites recorded intermittent ash emissions and regional infrasound sensors detected small explosions (table 5; fig. 55). Ash emissions increased considerably on April 16, when an ash cloud as high as ~20,000 ft (~6,100 m) ASL extended more than 350 km from the north cone of Mount Young. This change prompted AVO to raise the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level from ORANGE and WATCH to RED and WARNING. The next day, ash emissions declined and the volcano was lowered back to ORANGE and WATCH. Satellite imagery and regional infrasound sensors recorded intermittent, small explosions over the next few months.```"

However, the principal change to the area, and the site with the most discharge, was a new line of springs oriented en echelon to the 2019 springs and offset ~20 m to their southwest (fig. 4).New activity was also discovered at Shrub mud volcano’s summit when visited in 2021 (fig. 3), made apparent by both a fresh tree-kill area upslope from (east of) the summit pit and new mud deposits that coated the pit’s east wall (figs. 5, 6). The source of this mud was a string of recently opened springs (fig. 5) that actively discharged hot, muddy water. This line of springs started at the north wall of the pit, extended southeastward and uphill to just below the summit, then stretched back down to the south wall of the pit. The most active of these new springs was a small, sputtering geyser ~20 centimeters (cm) high with a temperature of ~54 degrees Celsius (ºC) (fig. 5). This temperature is the highest measured at Shrub mud volcano since 2000, before the summit pond formed. A few of the new springs were inactive, such as those on the barren slope above the south wall of the pit.

Satellite imagery recorded a corresponding ash plume shortly thereafter. An ashy plume from cone A was seen in webcam imagery after sunrise, confirming that an eruption was underway. AVO responded later that morning by increasing the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to ORANGE and WATCH. A retrospective analysis of high-resolution satellite imagery identified ash deposition near cone A and melting of glacial ice ~1 km to its east on February 28, but no signs of activity on February 25, suggesting that the eruption began between those two dates. Figure 18 shows a timeline of the activity observed at Mount Veniaminof in 2021. The eruption reached its climax on March 4–10, producing moderately to strongly elevated surface temperatures, ash emissions, and frequent explosions detected by infrasound. Several explosions on March 6 were heard and even felt in Perryville, ~35 km away. Webcam and satellite data from this period showed ash emissions from cone A and a steam plume from the growing melt pit east of the cone (fig. 19). Between March 6 and March 10, the ash plumes reached as high as ~15,000 ft (~4,600 m) ASL and traveled as far as 220 km from the volcano. Owing to the height and extent of these ash plumes, local flight restrictions were set in place on March 9. Tephra deposits from the ash plumes were mostly confined to the caldera, but some ash fell outside the caldera on March 8, reaching as far as 22 km from the vent. The ash during this interval was blown predominantly southeastward (figs. 17, 19B, 20).

Although no eruptive activity or unrest took place at Mount Spurr in 2021, one notable ice and rock avalanche was large enough to be recorded by regional geophysical sensors. This mass movement signal was recorded on Mount Spurr’s local seismic network (fig. 8) on April 7 at 05:22 AKDT (13:22 UTC). The event’s seismic waveforms indicated that it had a duration of ~2 minutes (fig. 9). Acoustic waves were likewise detected at station SPCP (on Mount Spurr) and at KENI infrasound array (near the City of Kenai, Alaska) (figs. 8, 10); these waves also had a coherent signal duration of ~2 minutes. No clear satellite views were available for this event, precluding AVO from identifying a precise source or deposit area and estimating the avalanche volume. However, the peak period of the long-period (LP) seismic energy was ~15 seconds, indicating that the event was smaller than the widely recorded Mount Spurr ice and rock avalanche of July 15, 2019 (Orr and others, 2023).

Although Iliamna Volcano has no known historical eruptions, past geologic studies there document evidence of late Holocene explosive activity and repeated, extensive mass wasting of its steep, hydrothermally altered edifice (Waythomas and Miller, 1999). Fumaroles at an elevation of ~2,740 m on the east flank of the volcano almost continuously produce plumes of steam condensate and volcanic gas (Werner and others, 2011). In the past three decades, researchers have documented two magmatic intrusions beneath Iliamna Volcano (Roman and others, 2004; Prejean and others, 2012).A large ice and rock avalanche took place on the east flank of Iliamna Volcano on August 5, 2021, at 07:21 AKDT (15:21 UTC). Afterward, satellite imagery and oblique aerial photographs showed a dark-colored flow deposit on Iliamna Volcano’s east-facing Red Glacier (fig. 11). This avalanche initiated less than 1 km from the volcano’s summit and traveled at least 4 km almost due east, generating seismic and acoustic signals recorded locally and regionally. High-frequency signals were clearly recorded on Iliamna Volcano’s seismic network (fig. 12). Farther away, the KENI infrasound array at Kenai (figs. 8, 13), and the HOM infrasound station in the City of Homer, Alaska, detected acoustic waves from the event. Red Glacier has hosted many avalanches historically and prehistorically (Waythomas and others, 2000); the most recent ice and rock avalanche of comparable size to this event occurred in June 2019 (Toney and others, 2021; Orr and others, 2023). These mass flows are generally composed of mostly ice and snow with smaller amounts of rock (involved through entrainment or as part of the original failure region). Avalanches on Red Glacier are highly mobile, traveling at mean speeds of ~50 meters per second (m/s) (Caplan-Auerbach and Huggel, 2007) and peak speeds, estimated via numerical modeling and seismic force inversion, of greater than (>) 70 m/s (Schneider and others, 2010; Toney and others, 2021).

The 1912 Novarupta-Katmai eruption—the largest eruption of the 20th century—produced ~17 cubic kilometers (km3) of fall deposits and 11 km3 of pyroclastic material that filled nearby valleys around the volcano (Hildreth and Fierstein, 2012). The pyroclastic deposit in these valleys is as much as 200 m thick, and some areas remain almost entirely devoid of vegetation more than a century after the eruption. When the landscape is snow-free, and particularly when the ground has little moisture content, strong winds can pick up this ash and create large ash clouds. The wind can then transport the resuspended ash, most often southeastward across Shelikof Strait, Kodiak Island, and the Gulf of Alaska.

Although they look identical to dispersing volcanic ash clouds in satellite imagery, they are not the result of volcanic activity. This resuspension phenomenon has been observed and documented many times over the last several decades (Hadley and others, 2004; Wallace and Schwaiger, 2019), including seven times in 2021. The events observed in 2021 did not warrant a change in the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level, which remained GREEN and NORMAL throughout the year.On August 28, 2021, strong winds picked up loose volcanic ash from the Mount Katmai (Novarupta) region and carried it southeastward toward Kodiak Island. The National Weather Service (NWS) had forecasted this event a few days prior, and when it occurred, the NWS Alaska Aviation Weather Unit (AAWU) reported cloud heights as much as ~6,000 ft (~1,800 m) ASL, issuing a significant meteorological information statement (SIGMET) for aviators. AVO also issued an Information Statement.The following month, strong winds again generated a cloud of resuspended ash that drifted over Kodiak Island. This event, like the one a month prior, was anticipated by the NWS a few days in advance. The drifting ash cloud appeared clearly in satellite data (fig. 14) for ~24 hours, starting in the afternoon of September 20. AAWU issued a SIGMET reporting ash at altitudes as high as ~8,000 ft (~2,400 m) ASL; AVO correspondingly issued an Information Statement. Trace ash fall was reported in the City of Kodiak, Alaska, and owing to the forecast of this event, a local observer was able to sample the ash fall and send it to AVO.Figure 14.  Oblique, processed satellite image showing a resuspended ash plume (in red) from the Mount Katmai (Novarupta) area extending across the Shelikof Strait to Kodiak Island, Alaska.

The volcano has a total volume of ~350 km3, making it one of the largest of the Aleutian Arc (Miller and others, 1998; Bacon and others, 2009). Extensive pyroclastic-flow deposits around Mount Veniaminof record the occurrence of two Holocene caldera-forming eruptions (Miller and Smith, 1987), but Mount Veniaminof is also one of the most active volcanoes in Alaska; it has erupted at least 20 times since 1830, including in 2021 (as described herein). All aforementioned historical eruptions were likely from cone A, the informal name for a prominent, 300-m-high cinder cone within the volcano’s 10-km-wide, ice-filled caldera (fig. 17). The last eruption of Mount Veniaminof prior to 2021 was in 2018 (Cameron and others, 2023; Waythomas, 2021).Mount Veniaminof showed no indication of activity at the start of 2021. In response to a prolonged local seismic network outage that started in December 2020, AVO changed the volcano’s Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level from GREEN and NORMAL to UNASSIGNED on January 15, 2021, reflecting the observatory’s limited ability to detect volcanic activity there. On March 1, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite identified unrest at Mount Veniaminof in the form of elevated sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. The TROPOMI sensor measures variations in the wavelength-dependent absorption of ultraviolet energy due to the presence of gases (such as ozone and SO2) and retrieves the amount of gas present in the total atmosphere to account for the observed absorption. On March 2, satellite imagery again showed SO2. Elevated surface temperatures began to appear in ```"

The volcano is ~115 km southwest of the City of Unalaska and ~1,400 km southwest of Anchorage (fig. 1). Mount Okmok is built on a base of Tertiary volcanic rocks and consists of three rock series: (1) older flows and pyroclastic beds of a pre-caldera shield complex, (2) pyroclastic deposits of two major caldera-forming eruptions, and (3) a post-caldera field of small, young cones and lava flows (Byers, 1959; Larsen and others, 2007). Mount Okmok has had 14 historical eruptions, which produced ash plumes that reached altitudes as high as ~49,000 ft (~15,000 m) ASL. Lava flows were emplaced on the caldera floor during only three eruptions in the last 70 years: those in 1945, 1958, and 1997 (Begét and others, 2005). The most recent eruption took place during the summer of 2008 and was phreatomagmatic, building a new intracaldera cone informally named Ahmanilix (fig. 30) (Neal and others, 2011). Thermal springs and fumaroles occur within the caldera and at Hot Springs Cove, located between Mount Okmok and Mount Recheshnoi (20 km to the southwest).In 2021, Mount Okmok continued the long-term deformation trend that began immediately after its 2008 eruption. This deformation takes place as discrete inflationary pulses superimposed onto a lower-rate, steady background inflation (fig. 31) and is consistent with ongoing accumulation of melt at shallow levels. One such pulse was recorded in 2021, appearing on the time-series plots for GNSS stations OKCE (fig. 32), OKNC, and OKSO. The total displacements of the 2021 pulse were similar to the totals of 2019 but larger than those of 2020 (see, for instance, the OKCE time series in figure 31), with amplitudes of 4–5 cm in the horizontal and ~5 cm in the vertical components. This inflation is roughly half that of 2018, when the volcano underwent ~10 cm of horizontal displacement and as many as 12 cm of vertical displacement (Cameron and others, 2023).From roughly the beginning of October through November 2021, Mount Okmok departed from its common deformation pattern by producing an additional inflationary pulse, prompting AVO to release an Information Statement. This pulse, which was observed at stations OKCE and OKNC (fig. 31), was consistent with a pressure increase at less than 1 km depth that had a source located near Cone D, south of Ahmanilix. Past analyses of GNSS and InSAR geodetic data suggest a shallow magma reservoir exists underneath the caldera floor of Mount Okmok (for example, Freymueller and Kaufman, 2010; Lu and Dzurisin, 2014).Cone DCone CAhmanilixCone ACone ECone FCone GCone BPACIFIC  OCEANUmnak IslandFigure 30.  Oblique aerial photograph of Mount Okmok on April 28, 2021, looking southwest.

The complex consists of several peaks, which are the remnants of Pleistocene volcanoes, and several cones that have been active in the Holocene, including Mount Kliuchef and Korovin Volcano (fig. 36). Mount Kliuchef is composed of a series of five vents aligned northeast-southwest. Its two main summit vents appear young—the eastmost was probably the source of an eruption in 1812 attributed to nearby Sarichef Volcano (Wood and Kienle, 1990). Korovin Volcano, ~6 km north of Mount Kliuchef, is a compound stratovolcano with two summit craters spaced 600 m apart (Miller and others, 1998). The southeast crater, which is the most recently active of the two, is ~1 km wide at the rim, several hundred meters deep, and holds a small lake. Beginning on August 10, 2021, AVO detected a swarm of earthquakes at Atka volcanic complex that lasted several days before tapering off (fig. 37). In response to this local seismicity, AVO raised the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to YELLOW and ADVISORY on August 11.AVO analysts located 204 earthquakes between August 10 and 12; these events had epicenters approximately 3–9 km west-southwest of Mount Kliuchef (fig. 36) and typical depths of 2–5 km below sea level. The largest earthquake took place on August 11 and had an ML of 2.5. Five other earthquakes exceeded ML 2.0. The rate of earthquakes began to decline after August 12 and returned to background levels by the end of the month. In response, AVO changed the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level of Atka volcanic complex to GREEN and NORMAL on August 27. Satellite imagery and infrasound sensors detected no anomalous activity or unrest around the time of the earthquake swarm, in contrast with observations from October 2020, when satellite data showed detectable SO2 emissions from the volcano in close conjunction with an increase in earthquake activity (Cameron and others, 2023).KONWKONEKOSEKOKVKOWEKOKLMountKliuchefKorovin VolcanoSarichef VolcanoAtkavolcaniccomplexAtkaAtkaIslandKOFPATKANazan BayKorovin Bay−174.000°−174.166°−174.333°52.333°52.166°010 KILOMETERS24680246 MILESBase from National MapWGS 1984 Web MercatorDepth (h), inkilometersLocal magnitude (ML)Monitoring stationh<00≤h<55≤h<10ML<00≤ML<11≤ML<2EXPLANATIONKONWFigure 36.  Map showing hypocenters located at Atka volcanic complex, Alaska, during August 10–12, 2021.

The volcano, which is ~40 km northeast of the City of Adak, Alaska, and ~1,900 km southwest of Anchorage (fig. 1), consists of an older, partly collapsed volcano and a younger resurgent cone with a summit crater 1.5 km in diameter (fig. 39) (Simons and Mathewson, 1955; Waythomas and others, 2003a). The volcano has erupted several times in the last 250 years (Waythomas and others, 2003b); its most recent eruption prior to 2021 was in 1974, when a steep-sided lava dome formed in the crater and produced at least one ash cloud, which was reported to have reached an estimated altitude of 10,000 ft (~3,000 m) ASL (Associated Press, 1974). A poorly documented eruption in 1945 also formed a lava dome, which was then partially destroyed by the 1974 eruption. Great Sitkin Volcano erupted in 2021 after a period of seismic unrest and minor steam explosions that began in 2016 (for example, Dixon and others, 2020).Leading up to 2021, activity at Great Sitkin Volcano was characterized by years of precursory seismicity, elevated surface temperatures, and gas emissions. This unrest culminated with a Vulcanian explosion on May 25, 2021, an event successfully forecasted by AVO in the hours prior. An effusive eruption then began in mid-July, gradually filling both ```"

This differs from previous visits, when workers observed a main upwelling area at the north end of the pond—in 2021, that area was covered in mud crossed by rivulets of warm water fed from upslope (fig. 6).

Its largely ice-covered summit cone might be a lava dome complex (Nye and Turner, 1990), although its last known eruption, calculated by correlating tephra deposits, took place ~5,200 years ago (Riehle, 1985). More recently, in 2004–2006, Mount Spurr experienced a period of unrest interpreted to be the result of new magma injecting to a shallow level beneath the volcano (Power, 2004; Power and others, 2004). This unrest was marked by elevated seismicity, magmatic gas emissions, the generation of debris flows, and increased heat flux, the last of which formed a water-filled ice cauldron at the volcano’s summit (Neal and others, 2005; Coombs and others, 2006; McGimsey and others, 2007; Neal and others, 2009). Although the summit of Mount Spurr has not erupted recently, a satellite vent 3.5 km south of the summit, named Crater Peak (fig. 7), produced explosive eruptions in 1953 and 1992 (Keith, 1995, and references therein). Both eruptions led to ashfalls that impacted populated areas in south-central Alaska.```"

Mount Gareloi has had 16 reports of eruptive activity since 1760, making it one of the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian Islands since the 1740s. The uninhabited volcano has two summit peaks (Miller and others, 1998), spaced ~500 m apart and separated by a narrow saddle, which have both been active historically (Coombs and others, 2012). The slightly higher north peak has an ~300-m-wide crater containing a small lake. The south peak has a crater that is open to the south and that hosts several active fumaroles on its west rim, often forming a conspicuous plume (fig. 51). Thirteen younger craters with diameters of 80–1,600 m are aligned on a fissure that extends south-southeastward from the southern summit to the coast (Coats, 1959). These craters formed during an explosive eruption in 1929 that also produced four blocky lava flows and deposited a blanket of glassy andesitic tuff over an area of 2.5 × 5 km on the volcano’s southeast flank (Coats, 1959). Mount Gareloi commonly shows low-energy, LP seismic activity sourced beneath its edifice, suggesting the presence of shallow magma interacting with a hydrothermal system (Harris and others, 2021). The volcano is currently monitored by a local seismic and infrasound network, satellite data, a webcam, and regional infrasound and lightning-detection networks. Beginning on May 18, 2021, anomalous seismicity was recorded at the Mount Gareloi. In particular, the low-energy LP events commonly observed at the volcano overlapped with a harmonic tremor recorded on every station on the island. The dominant tremor frequencies peaked at ~3.4 hertz (Hz), ~6.4 Hz, ~8.3 Hz, and ~10.7 Hz. These harmonic signals, which were intermittent during at least the previous day, became conspicuous after a regional ML 5.0 earthquake at ```"

This ash cloud drifted east across northern Kodiak Island at an apparently lower altitude (~5,000 ft [~1,500 m] ASL), though no ashfall was reported. This resuspension event also lasted ~24 hours, during which time AAWU issued a SIGMET and AVO issued an Information Statement.AVO observed the next minor cloud of resuspended ash in satellite views on September 26. This cloud drifted southeastward toward the middle of Shelikof Strait, never reaching Kodiak Island. No Information Statements were issued for this minor event.Before dawn on October 2, strong winds near Mount Katmai once again picked up loose volcanic ash and carried it southeastward toward Kodiak Island. As with most previous resuspension events at Mount Katmai in 2021, the NWS had forecasted the event a few days prior. AAWU issued a SIGMET and the NWS Forecast Office issued a Marine Weather Statement. AVO issued an Information Statement reporting ash clouds that reached altitudes of ~6,000 ft (~1,800 m) ASL. Meteorological clouds obscured satellite observations the next day, but the SIGMET remained in place for ~24 hours owing to the likelihood of continued ash resuspension.Starting on the morning of November 17, another cloud of resuspended ash appeared clearly in satellite data. Most of the typical source region for resuspended ash at Mount Katmai was covered in snow at the time, so this event’s ash source was apparently confined to valleys on the north side of Shelikof Strait, in the vicinity of Mount Katmai (fig. 15). AAWU issued a SIGMET reporting a cloud altitude as high as ~7,000 ft (~2,100 m) ASL; AVO correspondingly issued an Information Statement. Resuspended ash was visible in satellite data until about midnight, although reports of resuspended ash from the City of Kodiak continued into the following day. Residents in Kodiak collected trace ashfall.The last resuspension event in the Mount Katmai region in 2021 occurred on November 25.

The crater formed ~3,400 years ago during a catastrophic event that erupted 75 km3 of material (Miller and Smith, 1987; Dreher and others, 2005; Bacon and others, 2014). Many lava domes, lava flows, and scoria cones occupy the caldera interior (Neal and others, 2000); the largest intracaldera cone is Vent Mountain, which is 2.5 km in diameter and stands 430 m above the floor of the caldera.

The volcano is located on the Alaska Peninsula, east of the City of Cold Bay, Alaska, and with 38 documented eruptions since 1817, it is considered one of the most active volcanoes in North America. The most recent eruption began in 2021 and is described herein. Eruptions at Pavlof Volcano have ranged in style from Strombolian to Vulcanian (Waythomas and others, 2006), and as a dominantly open-vent system, many of the volcano’s eruptions occur with little precursory seismic activity or ground deformation observed in InSAR (Lu and Dzurisin, 2014; Pesicek and others, 2018). Prior to 2021, the last eruption at Pavlof Volcano took place in 2016 and was characterized by continuous seismic tremor, infrasound detections, and lightning accompanying ash emissions that rose to an altitude of ~20,000 ft (~6,100 m) ASL (Fee and others, 2017; Cameron and others, 2020).After a 9-month quiescent period that started in late 2020, seismic activity at Pavlof Volcano increased on July 9, 2021, in a distinct change from its background levels. Tremor periods observed on that date prompted AVO to increase the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level from GREEN and NORMAL to YELLOW and ADVISORY. From July 9 to August 5, seismic activity at the volcano was characterized by more volcanic tremor periods and occasional low-frequency events, but no outward signs of eruptive activity were observed. On August 5, 2021, clear webcam views of Pavlof Volcano showed episodic, low-level ash emissions (fig. 23). These intermittent ash bursts came from a new vent on the upper southeast flank of the volcano, which produced diffuse ash clouds that rose just above the summit and drifted roughly 10–15 km southeastward before dissipating. Seismic and infrasound data associated this activity with occasional small explosions and tremor.

The volcano has a caldera 7 km in diameter that formed 6,900–5,000 years ago, as well as several post-caldera cones (fig. 53) (Coombs and others, 2018). Mount Young, a cluster of three cones within the caldera, has erupted repeatedly in the Holocene, producing crystal-rich basaltic andesite lavas and tephras. The fall deposits associated with Mount Young are consistent with mostly small- to moderate-sized ash clouds, but some lapilli-size units suggest its eruptions have reached a volcanic explosivity index (VEI) value as high as 3 (Coombs and others, 2018). The north cone of Mount Young (figs. 53, 54) began erupting in 2018 and continued to do so into 2021. Prior to 2018, the last eruption at Semisopochnoi Island was in 1987 on the south side of the island at Sugarloaf Peak. This event produced a 90-km-long plume that was visible in satellite images. Pilots at the time also reported ash on the volcano’s flanks (Reeder, 1990). The most recent noneruptive unrest at Semisopochnoi Island before the 2018–2021 eruption began was a period of increased seismicity and deformation in 2014–2015. Modeling by DeGrandpre and others (2019) explained this unrest as the rapid intrusion of 0.072 km3 of magma (as two batches) into a spheroidal magma storage zone ~8 km beneath the caldera. Eruptive activity at Semisopochnoi Island, which began in September 2018, was characterized in 2021 by frequent, low-level ash emissions and explosions from the north cone of Mount Young (fig. 54). An equipment failure on Amchitka Island meant that activity observations during the first half of the year were limited to those from satellite imagery and Figure 53.  Map of Semisopochnoi Island, Alaska, showing the active north cone of Mount Young and Sugarloaf PeakRagged TopFennerLakeFenner CreekThreequarterconeRingworm craterAnvil PeakCEAPCEPECERBCERACESWCETUNorth coneMount YoungPerret Ridge52.02°51.96°51.90°179.50°179.60°179.70°179.80°Monitoring stationTephra sample locationEXPLANATIONCERA05 KILOMETERS12340123 MILESother important geographic features.

Mount Cleveland is ~75 km west of the community of Nikolski and ~1,525 km southwest of Anchorage. Its historical eruptions have been characterized by short-lived ash explosions, lava fountaining, lava flows, and pyroclastic flows. In February 2001, after 6 years of quiescence, Mount Cleveland had three explosive events that sent ash to altitudes as high as ~30,000 ft (~9,100 m) ASL, produced a pyroclastic flow that reached the ocean, and erupted a lava flow (Dean and others, 2004; McGimsey and others, 2005). Intermittent explosive eruptions took place every year from 2001 to 2020.Early 2021 was quiet at Mount Cleveland, so the volcano remained at UNASSIGNED—the monitoring network was insufficient to locate earthquakes, so the volcano did not warrant a GREEN/NORMAL status. On March 10, however, an earthquake large enough to be detected 100 km away on Umnak Island took place near Mount Cleveland. This earthquake, combined with the detection of weak thermal anomalies and SO2 emissions (figs. 34, 35) starting the following week, suggested an increased potential for an eruption.

AVO crews visited the volcano in June 2021 to sample the explosive eruption deposits and to carry out a gas and airborne imaging survey.2016–2021 Precursory UnrestVolcanic unrest began at Great Sitkin Volcano in July 2016 and was characterized by elevated seismicity, anomalous steam emissions from the summit crater, and a few small explosive events. The thousands of small earthquakes detected between 2016 and 2021 were located primarily in the shallow crust (between the surface and ~10 km depth) and had ML values of less than 3 (for example, Dixon and others, 2020). The elevated seismicity at Great Sitkin Volcano began waning in early 2020 and had declined to background levels before the end of that year, leading AVO to lower the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to GREEN and NORMAL on October 21, 2020.

The ~2-minute-long explosion was detected in seismic, infrasound, and satellite data, as well as by local observers (fig. 42). The eruption and resulting ash cloud led AVO to raise the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to RED and WARNING at 20:30 HADT on May 25 (05:30 UTC on May 26). After a decline in seismic activity and cessation of ash emissions, AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to ORANGE and WATCH at 07:31 HADT (16:31 UTC) on May 26.

The breadcrust bombs have a bulk andesite composition comprising a matrix of high-silica (rhyolitic?) glass and phenocrysts of highly zoned plagioclase, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, magnetite, and apatite (fig. 46). The high crystallinity, presence of both apatite and a silica groundmass phase, and evolved interstitial melt composition all suggest that the erupted magma was a shallow, low-pressure, and near-solidus magma plug. The coarse-grained, poorly sorted, and lithic-rich deposit characteristics also support a Vulcanian eruption mechanism, which is consistent with geophysical observations and photographs of the eruption event.

Harmonic tremor took place intermittently until May 27, when highly frequent and highly energetic LP events emerged, sometimes merging into continuous broadband tremor (fig. 52). An ~2-Hz infrasound signal was also recorded locally on June 3, although it was unclear if the signal was of volcanic origin. A monochromatic, ~7 Hz seismic signal lasting 15–20 min was recorded on June 6, while elevated-amplitude seismicity, ongoing since about May 27, continued. Hence, on June 8, AVO raised the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to YELLOW and ADVISORY. The increase in seismic activity likely reflected a change to the magmatic-hydrothermal system interaction. No indications of unrest, however, were observed by an AVO field crew that flew over the summit on May 23.Over the following two months, the elevated and anomalous seismicity continued intermittently; SO2 was detected in satellite imagery but was consistent with measurements from the last several years; light steaming was observed in partly cloudy satellite and webcam views of the volcano; and weakly elevated surface temperatures were sometimes observed in satellite data. No eruptive activity was observed in satellite views of the volcano and no activity was detected by local or regional infrasound sensors. Starting in the second week of July, seismic activity gradually diminished and returned to background levels. AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to GREEN and NORMAL on July 28, 2021.05/01/202106/01/202107/01/202108/01/202102004006008001,000DateAmplitude, in countsFigure 52.  Time-series graph showing the amplitude of long-period (LP) events automatically recorded during the 2021 episode of unrest at Mount Gareloi, Alaska.

Seismic activity remained elevated, although variably so, for the rest of the year, during which time tremor and explosion signals dominated the data (fig. 56). On September 20, increased ash emissions observed in satellite imagery (fig. 57A) again prompted AVO to raise the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level from ORANGE and WATCH to RED and WARNING. A large SO2 cloud associated with this increase in activity appeared in TROPOMI satellite data (fig. 57B). The following day, ash emissions declined, and Semisopochnoi Island was lowered to ORANGE and WATCH. The activity at the volcano for the rest of the year consisted of low-level ash emissions, seismic tremor, phreatomagmatic explosions, and many satellite SO2 detections (fig. 58).

Residents stated that the weak gas emissions contained minor amounts of entrained volcanic ash. These observations represented a departure from normal background activity, so the USGS increased the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level of Mount Pagan from UNASSIGNED to YELLOW and ADVISORY later that day.

Mount Pagan is located 500 km north-northeast of the U.S. Territory of Guam and 320 km north of island of Saipan (fig. 1). The volcano, which is nested within an older caldera ~6 km wide, is one of the most historically active volcanoes in the CNMI and may have formed in the past 1,000 years (Trusdell and others, 2006). The last large eruption (VEI 4) of Mount Pagan took place in 1981 (Banks and others, 1984) and preceded four decades of intermittent, weaker activity characterized by vigorous steam plumes and degassing from a shallow magma source. Because Mount Pagan is not monitored with ground-based geophysical instrumentation, the primary sources of information on it come from local observers and satellite image data.Mount PaganSummit craterSouth Pagan volcanoPACIFIC  OCEAN18.15°−145.70°−145.75°−145.80°18.10°18.05°04 KILOMETERS123012 MILESFigure 64.  Annotated satellite image of Pagan Island showing Mount Pagan and South Pagan volcano.

The reports also describe any notable observations at the other volcanoes AVO monitors. All observations are archived in a relational database. A second cadre of scientists from AVO and the USGS National Earthquake Information Center monitors volcano seismicity and infrasound using local and regional sensors. This team compiles three separate seismic reports daily, spaced ~8 hours apart. Like the daily remote sensing reports, the seismic reports are also catalogued in a relational database. As of December 31, 2019, 33 of the historically active volcanoes and volcanic fields in Alaska were instrumented with seismometers and other instrumentation operated by AVO. Included in this list are those volcanoes that have insufficient seismic instrumentation to calculate reliable earthquake hypocenters and magnitudes, or those whose real-time telemetry was not reliable enough to produce a complete record of earthquake activity in 2021. Specifically, Bogoslof volcano (an informally named, mostly submarine volcano near and under Bogoslof Island) was monitored by only one seismograph station and Mount Cleveland was monitored by only two local seismograph stations, so both lacked the minimum number of stations to locate earthquakes. Little Sitkin Island and Semisopochnoi Island were also considered unmonitored because the telemetry for each of their subnetworks was unreliable.The volcanoes in this report are presented in geographic order from east to west along the Aleutian Arc, followed by the CNMI. Each entry has a title block containing information about that volcano: its identifier number (#) assigned by the Smithsonian Institution Global Volcanism Program (GVP); its latitude, longitude, and summit elevation; the name of its geographic region; and an abbreviated summary of its 2021 activity.

AVO considers the historical period in Alaska to be since 1741, when written records of volcanic activity began. On the basis of a rigorous reanalysis of all volcanic activity accounts in Alaska (from many sources), Cameron and others (2018) concluded that 54 Alaskan volcanoes fit these criteria. In this report, we modify the number of historically active volcanoes to 52 because we consider (1) Korovin Volcano and Mount Kliuchef to be subfeatures of Atka volcanic complex and (2) Novarupta to be a subfeature of Mount Katmai. As geologic understanding of Alaskan volcanoes improves through additional fieldwork and modern radiometric dating techniques, our list of active volcanoes will continue to evolve.volcano and a summary of its past activity, then a detailed account of its activity in 2021, often with accompanying tables, images, figures, or all three. This information is derived from formal public AVO information products, internal online electronic logs compiled by AVO staff, and published material (such as Miller and others [1998]).AVO uses informal names for some volcanoes for clarity; the names provided by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (through the Geographic Names Information System) may match poorly with the volcanoes themselves. For example, Bogoslof volcano comprises more islands than Bogoslof Island. Alaska also has volcanoes without official place names, such as Takawangha volcano, which require the use of informal names.In this report, volcano locations (in decimal degrees latitude and longitude) are taken from AVO’s database of Alaskan volcanoes (Cameron and others, 2022). Measurements are presented in the International System of Units, except for altitudes, which are reported in feet (ft) above sea level (ASL), in line with Federal aviation standards, followed by meters (m). General date references are given in local time unless specified otherwise. Most volcanoes in Alaska are in the Alaska standard time (AKST) or Alaska daylight time (AKDT) zones, but all Aleutian volcanoes west of Umnak Island (see the community of Nikolski, Alaska, on figure 1) are in the Hawaii-Aleutian standard time (HAST) or Hawaii-Aleutian daylight time (HADT) zones. Mount Pagan falls within the Chamorro standard time (ChST) zone. During 2021, daylight saving time ran from March 14 to November 7.What is an “Eruption”?The specific use of the term “eruption” varies from scientist to scientist and has no universally agreed-upon definition. Here, we adopt the usage of Siebert and others (2010, p. 17), who define eruptions as “* * * events that involve the explosive ejection of fragmental material, the effusion of liquid lava, or both”. The critical elements of this definition are the nouns “ejection” and “effusion,” which refer to dynamic surface processes that pose some level of hazard. The presence or absence of “juvenile material,” or newly erupted rock, which can sometimes be ambiguous, is not relevant to this use of the term eruption, particularly when communicating a potential hazard. This definition does not, however, include passive volcanic degassing or hydrothermal fluid discharge.Volcanic Activity in Alaska and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana IslandsShrub Mud VolcanoNot listed in GVP database62.149°, −145.021°900 mKlawasi group mud volcano, Copper River BasinNEW MUD SPRINGSShrub mud volcano, the northernmost of the three Klawasi group mud volcanoes in the Copper River Basin of south-central Alaska, is located ~25 kilometers (km) east of the community of Glennallen, Alaska, and ~280 km northeast of the City of Anchorage, Alaska (figs. 1, 2).

Minor explosions and small ash emissions took place occasionally during the last two weeks of November 2021, although the volcano was obscured by clouds for much of this period.From late November through December, the Pavlof Volcano seismic network detected elevated seismicity consisting of episodic, sustained tremor periods and discrete low-frequency events. Many explosions were detected in seismic and infrasound data—these may have produced localized ballistic ejecta fallout around the active vent, as indicated by satellite data acquired on December 1, 2021 (fig. 28). On December 4, a webcam and a passing aircraft recorded minor ash emissions that rose from the summit of the volcano to an altitude of ~10,000 ft (~3,000 m) ASL. Satellite data from this period also commonly indicated moderately to strongly elevated surface temperatures. High-resolution satellite imagery collected during clear weather commonly showed lava effusion on the upper southeast flank of the volcano, as well as continued interaction with snow and ice that subsequently produced small lahars downslope from the lava flows. For instance, satellite images obtained on December 19, 2021, showed both an ~600-m-long lava flow and minor lahar deposits that extended ~1,300 m beyond the flow front (fig. 29).???????NorthwestflankSoutheastflank2021ventBase from Digital Globe, WorldView-3 satellite image acquired December 19, 2021  −161.894°55.419°55.427°−161.837°55.411°01 KILOMETER0.500.250.5 MILES2016 CraterTrace ash-fall deposits2007 crater2021 lava flowsCone KLahar depositsApproximate boundaryTopographic divideUnknown or uncertain boundaryEXPLANATION?Figure 29.  Annotated map of features and deposits on the southeast flank of Pavlof Volcano, Alaska.

Soon afterward (March 26), an earthquake of local magnitude (ML) 4.3 took place near Mount Cleveland.High-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data spanning March 9 to March 20 recorded slight subsidence within the crater, which seemed to correlate with the appearance of elevated surface temperatures and gas emissions there. The crater was previously floored by cold rubble, so subsidence above the conduit may have formed openings that allowed heat and gases to escape more readily. Near-infrared temperatures in the crater rose above 600 ºC, indicating magma near the surface.Detections of thermal anomalies, SO2 emissions, a summit plume, and crater floor subsidence continued with little change over the next several months (fig. 34). However, by late summer, signs of unrest had declined: the volcano had quieted seismically, subsidence had ceased, gas emissions were no longer being detected, and thermal anomalies had declined in both strength and frequency. In response to this dwindling activity, AVO changed the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to UNASSIGNED on October 20. Detections of elevated surface temperatures continued occasionally through the end of the year, but activity at the volcano overall remained low.ABMount ClevelandMount ClevelandMount ClevelandCarlisle IslandSO2 plumeCMount ClevelandPlumeD012 KILOMETERS01 MILE02 KILOMETERS100.51 MILE0100 KILOMETERS204060800204060 MILESFigure 35.  Satellite and oblique aerial images of Mount Cleveland, Alaska, in 2021.

sir20245014.pdf,"media/sir20245014.pdf:```Volcanic Activity in Alaska and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands    35Characterization of the May 25 EruptionAnalysis of geophysical, geological, and remote sensing data suggest that the May 25 explosion of Great Sitkin Volcano was a Vulcanian eruption. The event produced high-amplitude infrasound (~190 pascals at 6 km distance) and was preceded by a slow pressure rise (fig. 43), a phenomenon that is consistent with other Vulcanian explosions and is caused by pre-explosion inflation of a dome or plug feature (for example, Yokoo and others, 2009; Iezzi and others, 2020). The explosion infrasound signal also showed two peaks in pressure that were likely related to a multi-part failure of the dome. After the main explosion, lower-amplitude infrasound emissions were recorded for tens of seconds. The explosion produced an ash cloud (fig. 42) that quickly detached and drifted northeastward before dispersing. The next day, TROPOMI data showed an SO2 plume over the Bering Sea consistent with the eruptive cloud’s trajectory. The explosion also widened the pre-existing explosion crater in the 1974 dome (fig. 39B), blasting large blocks (wider than 2 m) of old, altered lavas into a radial ballistic field ~1.5 km in diameter (fig. 44). Some likely landed warm because they were found in deep melt pits (fig. 44B) when observed later by AVO geologists. Other eruptive deposits were a trace tephra deposit extending 5 km east-southeast, dark pyroclastic surge deposits ~1 km long, and a lahar that extended 2 km downslope to the south (fig. 44). Extending between the lahar starting point at the southeast crater rim and the vent within the crater was a 600-m-long, pyroclastic flow deposit made of large, altered blocks, some more than 3 m in diameter.

Steaming, elevated surface temperatures, and SO2 emissions were observed through mid-July. On July 23, high-resolution TerraSAR-X spotlight SAR imagery showed a small, new lava dome in the center of the explosion crater (fig. 48). No lava was present in previous imagery from July 14, so lava effusion began sometime during the period of July 14–23. In response to the onset of effusion, AVO raised the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level to ORANGE and WATCH on July 23.Lava overflowed the explosion crater by August 4, spreading radially over the 1974 and 1945 lava domes and onto the ice that filled the east part of the summit crater. The lava effusion in July and August was accompanied by steam and SO2 emissions; incandescence; saturated SWIR and mid-infrared satellite data; and elevated seismicity (fig. 40). Lava effusion rates were 3–7 cubic meters per second (m3/s) in August as estimated by mapping the flow extent and thickness. This mapping was produced using high-resolution optical and radar satellite imagery, as well as the thermal radiative power measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (satellite sensors). The effusion rate declined after August, dropping to ~2 m3/s in September and falling below 1 m3/s in November (fig. 49). Seismicity and SO2 emissions also waned when effusion rates declined in September. Lava began to overflow the summit crater in September, eventually forming three flow lobes that advanced down the steep flanks of the volcano: a west lobe that started by September 19, a south lobe that started by September 29, and a north lobe that started by November 12.

Approximately 50 percent of the material was less than 50 micrometers in diameter. No larger ballistic particles were observed, including on the flanks of the north cone. The internal structures of deposits were not preserved; thus, the samples represent a bulk aggregate of deposits from throughout the spring of 2021. A microscopic analysis of the samples showed that they are mostly crystal-lithic grains or loose crystals. A minor proportion of the grains are scoriaceous juvenile material characterized by low vesicularity and microlitic glass (fig. 59A). Microlite phases comprise plagioclase, clinopyroxene (augite and pigeonite), orthopyroxene, and iron-titanium oxides (fig. 59B). 01/01/202102/01/202103/01/2021UNASSIGNEDYELLOWREDORANGE04/01/202105/01/202106/01/202107/01/202108/01/202109/01/202110/01/202111/01/202112/01/202101/01/2022DateABEXPLANATIONAsh plumeSteam plumeAmbiguous plumeTROPOMI SO2 detectionThermal emissionsBarely elevatedModerately elevatedAmbiguous thermal anomalyFigure 58.  Timeline of Aviation color codes (A) and remote sensing observations (B) at Semisopochnoi Island, Alaska, in 2021.

The sudden increase in seismic activity was uncharacteristic of the area, prompting AVO to raise the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level from UNASSIGNED to YELLOW and ADVISORY on December 10 in anticipation of possible volcanic activity. Seismicity waned gradually over the next week and the swarm seemingly ceased on December 20. The hypocenters of earthquakes from the swarm formed a northeast-southwest trending lineation north of the volcano (fig. 63A). However, this linear trend is interpreted to be an artifact because the earthquakes were located outside the regional network—the closest seismic stations are the four on Little Sitkin Island, ~12 km east of Davidof volcano. The earthquakes occurred at a variety of depths, the deepest of which was 9.8 km below sea level (fig. 63B). Notably, the swarm produced 2 earthquakes of ML >4 and 13 earthquakes of ML >3. On December 29, more than one week after the swarm ended, AVO lowered the Aviation Color Code and Volcano Alert Level of Davidof volcano to UNASSIGNED.
